# Implementation Roadmap

Status: active roadmap, updated 2026-08-17

Live decisions and the current implementation boundary are recorded in
[Project Status and Decisions](PROJECT_STATUS.md). GitHub issues and one GitHub
Project track execution; this document defines ordering and exit criteria.

## Objective

Build gufo incrementally from a deterministic, testable vertical slice.
Do not begin with the complete server, continuous batching, and heterogeneous
execution simultaneously.

Qwen3.5-0.8B is the rapid-iteration and correctness fixture. Qwen3.8-27B is the
first production model. Both use curated compiled model kinds over shared
runtime primitives; model dimensions, kernels, tuning, and acceptance records
remain explicit rather than inferred by a general architecture loader.

The first useful system is:

```text
safetensors source
    -> validated text-only conversion
    -> compiled Qwen3.5/Qwen3.8 implementation family
    -> GPU-only greedy inference
    -> terminal prompt
    -> exact-token, full-logit, and performance report
```

This path establishes the model contract, tensor orientation, tokenizer, KV
state, numerical oracle, kernel interfaces, and performance baseline required
by later work.

An independent early NPU feasibility track validates XRT, AIE programs,
XRT-BO/dma-buf import into HIP, explicit ownership transfer, and sustained
concurrent operation before the common weight layout is frozen. Its evidence
and probe matrix are recorded in [NPU_RESEARCH.md](NPU_RESEARCH.md).

## Delivery Rules

- Use Qwen3.5-0.8B for fast iteration and Qwen3.8-27B for production acceptance.
- Make single-request direct greedy execution correct before adding sampling,
  interactive chat, or HTTP.
- Make the GPU path correct before depending on the NPU.
- Establish CPU and full-quality oracles before optimizing kernels.
- Keep numerical source and tuning private to each curated model kind.
- Treat current SHQ bytes as a candidate contract; freeze v1 only after CPU,
  GPU, AIE, and malformed-artifact conformance gates pass.
- Retain a performance change only when the end-to-end workload improves.
- Every milestone leaves the repository in a runnable and testable state.

## Milestone 0: Repository and Toolchain

### Tasks

1. Initialize the repository and add the complete MIT `LICENSE`.
2. Add `NOTICE` and an initial `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
3. Create the C++20 CMake project and top-level source layout.
4. Add development, release, sanitizer, and test build presets.

- CPU quantization/dequantization vectors are byte exact.
- Teacher-forced full-vocabulary logits can be captured and compared.
- Tests distinguish source dtype from accumulation dtype.

## Milestone 3: Early GPU and NPU Format Feasibility

This milestone has two parallel engineering tracks. It does not yet implement a
complete model.

### GPU track

1. Implement model-private Qwen SHQ4-T16 decode GEMV.
2. Implement model-private Qwen SHQ8-T16 decode GEMV.
3. Implement small-row and prefill candidates for Q4 and Q8.

5. Record ISA, occupancy, bandwidth, alignment, and tail behavior.

### NPU track

1. Compile and execute a minimal model-private AIE2P program through XRT.
2. Implement W4A8, W8A8, and BF16 GEMM microbenchmarks.
3. Measure large/high-arithmetic-intensity GEMM and batch-1 GEMV separately;
   do not infer decode performance from GEMM TOPS.
4. Validate the T16 microtile ordering and scale epilogues.
5. Test a small set of reusable row/column shape buckets and record the cost of
   program/configuration changes.
6. Measure context creation, program load, command submission, DMA overlap, and
   completion overhead.

### Shared-allocation track

1. Allocate an XRT BO, export its DRM PRIME/dma-buf FD, and attempt import and
   mapping through HIP external memory on gfx1151.
2. Alternate HIP and NPU producer/consumer access with explicit completion waits
   and required cache maintenance; do not depend on implicit dma-buf fencing.
3. Stress full- and partial-range handoffs over multiple allocation sizes for at
   least 10,000 iterations.
4. Measure one-way ownership-transition latency without copying payload bytes.
5. Measure immutable simultaneous GPU/NPU reads.
6. Run sustained ROCm+XDNA2 concurrent load and record firmware stalls, resets,
   corruption, bandwidth contention, and decode-latency impact.
7. Test lossless backend views and explicit-copy fallback tiers.
8. Decide whether one-copy heterogeneous operators are viable.

### Exit criteria

- CPU, HIP, and AIE results agree under their declared numerical contracts.
- The common layout has measured results on both accelerators.
- The memory interoperability tier is selected from evidence.
- The SHQ candidate is frozen as v1 or revised before published artifacts depend
  on long-term compatibility.
- Unstable or slower NPU paths remain disabled rather than blocking GPU work.

## Milestone 4: Qwen GPU-Only Vertical Slice

### Tasks

1. Implement transactional model loading and checksum validation.
2. Implement model-private Qwen GPU operations:
   - Embeddings.
   - RMS normalization.
   - RoPE.
   - Q/K/V and output projections.
   - Decode and prefill attention.
   - Gate, up, and down projections.
   - Residual paths.

3. Implement the initial contiguous KV cache.
4. Implement deterministic greedy sampling.
5. Implement request-owned model and sampling state.
6. Implement the capability evaluation drift gate, trace format, and offline

8. Add exact-token fixtures comparing the native CLI with the pinned reference.
9. Add sampling and `gufo chat` only after the greedy slice passes.
10. Add eager execution first; add HIP graphs only after correctness.

Start with BF16 or SHQ8 where it simplifies bring-up, then introduce SHQ4
tensor by tensor. Do not debug every low-bit kernel simultaneously.

### Exit criteria

- A safetensors-derived artifact produces text from a terminal prompt.
- Greedy token history is deterministic.
- Layer outputs and full logits pass the declared oracle thresholds.

6. Search candidate recipes at a small number of explicit byte targets.
7. Validate every candidate against teacher logits, perplexity, tasks, and
   hardware performance.

- Every published size has an independent quality and performance report.
- Measured BPW and file/resident byte counts match the payload.
- GPU kernels consume converted artifacts without runtime repacking unless a
  retained benchmark explicitly justifies a model-private view.
- At least one artifact meets the model-wide release objective.

## Out of Scope and Deferred Work

The following are out of scope rather than future compatibility goals:

- Windows or macOS support.
- CUDA compatibility.
- General architecture loading.

Do not place the following on the critical path for the first production model:

- Arbitrary JIT kernels.
- Packed Q5 formats.
- Sub-four-bit production weights.
- Multiple models resident by default.
- Multimodal serving. The first Qwen3.8-27B artifact is explicitly text-only and
  excludes the vision encoder; any later multimodal artifact is separate.
- Speech, image, or video generation.

## First Backlog

The first concrete issues should be opened in this order:

1. Add the MIT license and repository skeleton.
2. Create CMake presets and build `gufo --version`.
3. Implement `gufo diagnose`.
4. Add HIP and XRT smoke programs.
5. Define tensor descriptors and checked byte arithmetic.
6. Implement safetensors inspection.
7. Implement Qwen tokenizer conformance tests.
8. Add teacher-logit artifact capture and comparison.
9. Commit SHQ4-T16, SHQ6-T16, and SHQ8-T16 conformance vectors.
10. Implement Qwen-private HIP Q8 GEMV.
11. Implement Qwen-private HIP Q4/SHQ6 decode kernels.
12. Implement AIE2P W8A8, W4A8, and BF16 GEMM microbenchmarks.
13. Prove or reject XRT-BO/dma-buf import into HIP with explicit handoffs.
14. Decide the shared-allocation interoperability tier.
15. Freeze or revise the SHQ candidate as SHQ-T16 v1.
16. Execute one Qwen layer from converted weights.
17. Produce the first deterministic GPU-only terminal completion.
