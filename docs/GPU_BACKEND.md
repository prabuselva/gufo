# ROCm/HIP GPU Backend

Status: design draft, 2026-08-11

## Purpose

The GPU backend is a native HIP implementation compiled specifically for the
Strix Halo `gfx1151` RDNA 3.5 GPU.

It must not depend on:

- CUDA headers or libraries.
- `.cu` source files.
- hipify-generated sources.
- PyTorch, ATen, or Triton.
- vLLM runtime components.

hipBLASLt provides selected production BF16 prefill algorithms, while rocBLAS
provides baselines and fallback algorithms. Model-critical paths may still use
custom HIP kernels where profiling demonstrates a benefit. Composable Kernel
provides a fused causal GQA fallback for shapes not handled by a native tile.

## Build

Use CMake with C++20 and HIP as first-class languages:

```cmake
project(strix LANGUAGES CXX HIP)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES gfx1151)
```

GPU source files use `.hip`. Release packages contain only `gfx1151` code
objects unless a development build explicitly enables another architecture.

Compiler version, flags, ROCm version, kernel source hash, and architecture are
part of every cached artifact key.

### hipBLASLt plan database

Large BF16 prefill projections can use an optional offline-tuned hipBLASLt
plan database:

```sh
git add .
nix build

./result/bin/tune_hipblaslt \
  --out "$HOME/.cache/strix/hipblaslt-plans.bin"

STRIX_HIPBLASLT_PLAN_CACHE="$HOME/.cache/strix/hipblaslt-plans.bin" \
  ./result/bin/strix-server prompt --model "$MODEL" "Hello"
```

The tuner covers the seven Qwen3.8 projection shapes at prompt batches
`32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096`. `--quick` limits development runs to the
batch-128 FFN gate/up shape; `--batch` and repeated `--shape MxK` options
select custom matrices.

The binary database stores:

- A format version and gfx1151 device fingerprint.
- HIP runtime and hipBLASLt library versions.
- Batch, M, K, and BF16 data type.
- Algorithm ID and the same-version serialized hipBLASLt descriptor.
- Required workspace, tuning median, solution name, and kernel name.

Runtime loading is opt-in. A compatible hit reconstructs the first algorithm
through hipBLASLt to initialize its solution library, then restores later
descriptors directly. Every restored algorithm is checked with
`matmulIsAlgoSupported`, including its exact workspace requirement. A schema,
device, runtime, library, algorithm-ID, kernel-identity, support, or workspace
mismatch falls back to the ordinary heuristic search for that exact shape.
The hot path remains the existing in-memory plan lookup after first use.

## Backend Boundary

The model runtime calls whole operations through raw-pointer interfaces:

```cpp
struct HipExecutionContext {
    hipStream_t stream;
    ScratchArena scratch;
    ProfilingSink* profiling;
};

Status model_prefill(..., HipExecutionContext&);
Status model_decode_batch(..., HipExecutionContext&);
Status model_verify(..., HipExecutionContext&);
```

Kernel entry points use:

- Raw pointers.
- Fixed-width integer dimensions.
- POD configuration structs.
- Explicit stream arguments.
- Preallocated scratch.

Do not pass framework tensor objects into the backend.

## Runtime Components

### Device

- Require `gfx1151`.
- Record CU count, wave mode, available memory, clock state, and runtime version.
- Reject accidental `gfx1100` aliases in production packages.

### Allocator

- Suballocate large aligned arenas.
- Separate immutable weights, persistent session state, KV pages, graph-stable
  buffers, and transient scratch.
- Perform no timed-path allocation.
- Integrate with the shared GPU/NPU allocation broker where visibility is
  proven.

### Streams and Events

Initial stream classes:

- Latency-critical decode.
- Bulk prefill/verification.
- Background copy and persistence.

Additional streams require profile evidence. Shared memory bandwidth and queue
contention can make nominal overlap slower.

### HIP Graphs

Capture stable shape buckets after:

- All allocations are complete.
- Pointer identities are stable.
- Kernel selection is finalized.
- Correctness matches eager execution.

Cache graphs by model, route, physical row width, context policy, and
speculative topology. Graph replay is an overhead optimization, not a memory
bandwidth optimization.

## Kernel Families

### Single-token decode

- Wave32 GEMV.
- Fused SHQ4-T16 unpack, zero correction, scale, and dot.
- Multi-output and dual-projection variants where input reuse is material.
- Fused model-specific tails only when they reduce full wall time.

This path is primarily optimized for:

- Coalesced weight reads.
- Sufficient outstanding memory operations.
- Minimal redundant activation reads.
- Occupancy without excessive registers.
- Low launch count.

### Prefill and batched verification

- 16 x 16 x 16 WMMA-class kernels.
- Compact active-row schedules.
- T16 weights staged into device-friendly fragments.
- Separate algorithms for large dense tensors and small verifier shapes.
- hipBLASLt baseline for large standard GEMMs.

Do not route all `M > 1` shapes through WMMA. Small row counts may still favor
row-tiled GEMV.

### Attention

- Fused RoPE and Q/K preparation where model-specific fusion is beneficial.
- Native Qwen3.8 causal GQA tiles adapted from llama.cpp's MIT online-softmax
  scheduling for long prompts, with Composable Kernel as a shape fallback.
- Chunked prefill keeps activation batches bounded while carrying absolute
  positions and persistent KV/recurrent state across context frontiers.
- Single-token Qwen3.8 attention below 4K uses the graph-captured one-wave
  FP32 online-softmax kernel.
- At 4K and deeper positions, decode attention uses 32 sequence partitions.
  Each partition writes an FP32 `(max, sum, weighted value)` partial and a
  second kernel applies the stable online-softmax merge formula. The scratch
  region is preallocated and reused between attention layers.
- Long-context split-K decode bypasses the fixed-shape HIP graph. Attention
  dominates at these contexts, and host-selected grid dimensions avoid
  launching empty partitions on the short-context fast path.
- Paged KV attention.
- Separate single-token and batched attention kernels.
- GQA-aware K/V reuse.
- Long-context kernels selected by measured context ranges.

Known limitation: an incremental prefill that begins on the baseline attention
path and later crosses the optimized-attention threshold can select the tiled
backend with a nonzero start position. The baseline path updates the FP32 KV
cache, while the tiled path consumes a separate FP16 cache and currently packs
only the active chunk. Until cache-coherence tracking or prefix conversion is
implemented and validated on gfx1151, treat baseline-to-tiled transitions as a
separate correctness/performance follow-up rather than changing that policy as
part of structural refactors.

### MoE

- GPU router and top-k baseline.
- Row/expert compaction.
- Grouped expert GEMM for populated expert tiles.
- Selected-expert GEMV for sparse decode.
- Fused weighted expert combination where correctness permits.

### Sampling

- Device-side greedy argmax.
- Temperature, top-k, top-p, penalties, and seeded RNG.
- Grammar and structured-output constraints through a bounded device/host
  contract.
- No full-vocabulary host transfer in the ordinary path.

## Quantization Paths

The shared artifact family is `SHQ-T16`. Its first required tensor encodings
are `SHQ4-T16`, `SHQ8-T16`, and BF16.

GPU decode normally consumes BF16 activations directly. Prefill and verifier
paths may quantize activations to INT8 once and reuse that buffer across
multiple projections.

Required quant kernels:

- BF16/F16 to dynamic INT8 activation blocks.
- SHQ4-T16 GEMV.
- SHQ4-T16 small-row GEMM.
- SHQ4-T16 WMMA staging and GEMM.
- SHQ8-T16 and BF16 sensitive-tensor paths.

Each model supplies its own implementation of the required paths. This list is
an interface requirement, not a shared kernel library.

All backend paths must match one CPU dequantization contract before full-model
testing.

## gfx1151-Specific Rules

- Assume wave32 only in kernels explicitly compiled and tested for wave32.
- Use native `gfx1151` compilation and inspect generated ISA for critical paths.
- Do not transfer launch geometry from W7900 or `gfx1100` without a new
  benchmark.
- Treat approximately 200-221 GB/s as the practical read ceiling until the
  exact HIP workload measures otherwise.
- Avoid repeated-lane loads that have shown unsafe behavior in generic
  gfx1151 Triton patterns.
- Keep resource usage low enough to maintain useful occupancy on 40 CUs.
- Tune thermal and sustained-clock behavior, not only short benchmark peaks.

## Model Isolation

Each compiled-in model implementation owns its GPU kernels:

```text
models/<model>/gpu/gfx1151/
```

Each model is compiled as an independent object target with unique host and
device symbol prefixes. The final link places all targets in the single
`strix-server` executable, but does not merge their kernel ownership.

There is no global numerical kernel registry or production `common/kernels`
directory. A model binds its tensors to its own dispatch table during load.
The optional hipBLASLt database is an external, versioned deployment artifact
containing exact standard-library GEMM shapes, not a compiled kernel registry.

Shared runtime helpers may provide allocation, graph capture, raw launch
plumbing, streams, events, error handling, and profiling. They do not contain:

- Dot products, dequantization, attention, MoE, sampling, or model epilogues.
- Kernel launch geometry or tuning constants.
- Model tensor-shape assumptions.
- Generated HIP kernel bodies.

When a kernel idea is useful to another model, copy its source into the other
model and establish independent tests and ownership. Do not use symlinks,
source includes across model directories, or a generator output shared by
multiple model targets.

Different size variants of the same model reuse that model's private kernel
set. Their manifests bind tensors to model-local encoding specializations.

A model-private change must preserve the compiled code-object and ISA hashes of
other models. A shared-runtime change triggers independent correctness and
performance gates for every affected model.

- Kernel CPU oracle tests.
- Eager versus HIP graph tests.
- Exact greedy token tests.
- Full-logit and layer-output comparisons.
- Alignment, tails, and non-multiple dimensions.

- Cancellation at scheduler commit boundaries.
- No allocation during timed execution.
- Scratch and graph lifetime accounting.
- Long-duration thermal benchmarks.

- Direct runtime versus server-path parity.
- Model-private dependency-graph enforcement.
- Unchanged code-object and ISA hashes for untouched models.
