# Command-Line Interface

The `gufo` executable provides terminal interfaces for:

- Interactive conversations.
- One-shot prompt testing.
- Piped and scripted generation.
- Testing a locally loaded runtime without HTTP.
- Testing an already running OpenAI-compatible server.

The CLI is a transport adapter over the same request, scheduler, tokenizer,
sampling, and model implementations used by the HTTP server. It must not
contain a second inference path.

## Functionalities

This is an exhaustive list of functionalities and features offered by the gufo cli, the mapping between features and flags is not documented here and should be discovered using the `--help` command to avoid divergences between the implementation and the documentation.

The current supported modality are: llm, video, audio (tts, asr).

### LLM or text

**Model identity**

- `servedModelName` — the name the server reports to clients (for example in
  `/v1/models`). In practice: what your client's "model" field should say.
  Purely cosmetic, it does not change which weights are loaded.

**Size and memory**

- `context` (alias `batchSize`) — how many tokens of conversation the model
  keeps in memory. In practice: bigger means longer chats fit without the
  model "forgetting" the start, but prefill gets slower and more memory is
  used.
- `prefillChunk` (alias `ubatchSize`) — how many prompt tokens are processed
  per GPU pass while ingesting your prompt. In practice: a speed/memory knob
  for prefill; you rarely need to touch it.
- `maxTokens` — maximum number of tokens a request may generate. In practice:
  stops a model that rambles forever.

**Sampling (how the next token is picked)**

- `temperature` (alias `temp`) — randomness of the choice. Low (for example
  0.2) gives predictable, repetitive answers; high (1.0+) gives varied,
  creative ones. Greedy decoding is the low extreme.
- `topP` — only consider the smallest set of tokens whose probabilities add
  up to P (nucleus sampling). In practice: a "keep only plausible tokens"
  filter; lower means safer output.
- `topK` — only consider the K most likely tokens. The same idea as `topP` but
  with a fixed count instead of a probability mass.
- `minP` — discard tokens whose probability is below a fraction of the best
  token's probability. A modern alternative to `topP`/`topK` that stays
  consistent across models.
- `minKeep` — always keep at least N candidates after those filters. In
  practice: prevents the filters from ever leaving just one choice, so the
  sampler keeps working as intended.
- `seed` — fixed random seed. Same seed plus same prompt gives the same output,
  which makes runs reproducible.
- `repeatPenalty` — makes tokens that already appeared less likely. In
  practice: the anti-loop knob, stops "the the the the".
- `repeatLastN` — how far back the repeat penalty looks. Larger windows catch
  loops that build up over long outputs.
- `frequencyPenalty` — a penalty that grows the more often a token has already
  been used. Reduces word-for-word repetition.
- `presencePenalty` — a flat penalty for any token used at least once. Pushes
  the model toward new words and topics even if it used each only once.

**Reasoning models**

- `think` (`"on"` / `"off"` / `"auto"`) — whether the model produces its
  visible thinking before answering. In practice: off for quick chats, on
  for hard problems, auto lets the model decide per request.
- `reasoningEffort` (`"auto"`, `"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`,
  `"xhigh"`, `"max"`) — how long the model is allowed to reason before
  answering. More effort usually means better answers on hard tasks, at the
  cost of slower responses and more generated tokens.
- `preserveThinking` (`"on"` / `"off"` / `"auto"`) — whether earlier turns'
  thinking is kept in the conversation history. In practice: keeping it can
  help follow-up questions that build on the previous reasoning, at the cost
  of eating context.

**Disk cache**

- `cacheDisk` — enable an on-disk cache of computed prompt state, reused
  across requests and restarts. In practice: repeated or shared prompts get
  much faster; costs disk space.
- `cacheDiskBytes` — the maximum size of that cache on disk.
- `cacheDiskStagingBytes` — scratch space used while writing new cache
  entries. Must fit alongside `cacheDiskBytes`.

**Speculative decoding**

A draft model proposes tokens for the target model to verify. Greedy decoding
must reproduce the target's tokens; sampled decoding must preserve the target's
distribution, but need not match an autoregressive run's sequence for the same
seed. Speed depends on acceptance and verification cost.

- `speculative` — `dflash2` for Qwen3.8-27B, `dspark` for DeepSeek V4 Flash,
  `mtp` for models with a supported MTP head, or `off`. HTTP serving
  supports `dflash2`, `dspark`, and Flash-Next `mtp`.
- `dflashModel` — path to the DFlash2 companion draft.
- `dsparkModel` — path to the DSpark support GGUF.
- `mtpModel` — path to the MTP draft model.
- `draftTokens` — maximum tokens drafted per step. Wider drafts go faster
  when the guesses are accepted and waste work when they are rejected.
- `draftPolicy` (`"fixed"` / `"adaptive"`) — DFlash2 block-length policy;
  defaults to adaptive.
- `minDraftTokens` — minimum draft length where supported. DFlash2, DSpark,
  and Flash-Next MTP require the default of one.

**Server limits (protecting the machine from clients)**

- `maxPending` — maximum requests waiting in the queue. Over the limit,
  clients wait or are refused rather than exhausting memory.
- `maxPendingPerClient` — the same cap but per client, so one client cannot
  hog the whole queue.
- `requestTimeoutMs` — requests are killed after this many milliseconds. In
  practice: prevents stuck requests from holding GPU sessions forever.
- `maxOutputBytes` — maximum response size per request.
- `maxBufferedOutputBytes` — maximum generated-but-not-yet-delivered output
  buffered for one request; protects against slow clients.
- `maxBufferedOutputTotal` — the same buffer budget across all requests.

**Hardware**

- `cpu` — force CPU-only execution. In practice: very slow, useful only for
  debugging when no GPU is available.

### Video

TODO

### Audio (TTS and ASR)

One `gufo serve audio` server can host Qwen3-TTS synthesis, Qwen3-ASR
transcription, or both at once. `tts`, `asr`, and `stt` are accepted as
alternative spellings of the same subcommand; `asr` and `stt` additionally
route a bare `--model` to the ASR service instead of the TTS default.

**Models**

- `ttsModel` — path to the Qwen3-TTS safetensors directory (Base,
  CustomVoice, or VoiceDesign). In practice: enables
  `POST /v1/audio/speech`, text to spoken audio.
- `asrModel` — path to the Qwen3-ASR-1.7B safetensors directory. In
  practice: enables `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`, audio to text.
- Set both on one server and the same port offers speech in and speech out.

**Size and memory**

- `ttsContext` — the context budget reserved for TTS. In practice: how long
  a script you can synthesize in one request; bigger costs memory.
- `asrContext` — the context budget reserved for ASR. In practice: caps how
  long an audio file can be in one transcription request.

**Voices**

- `voices` — named voice presets built from reference WAVs. Each entry is
  either a bare reference WAV (its transcript is read from a `.txt` sidecar
  file beside it) or the `--voice` / `--voice-text` / `--voice-lang` triple:
  the reference WAV, its transcript (inline text or a path to a file holding
  it), and an optional default language for that voice. In practice: clients
  pick a voice by name in the request, for example `{"voice":
"narrator_ita"}`, without shipping audio; the optional language means the
  caller does not need to repeat it. Voices require a TTS checkpoint.

```sh
gufo serve audio \
  --tts-model models/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base \
  --voice narrator_eng=/audio/clear-english-voice.wav \
  --voice-text narrator_eng=/audio/clear-english-voice.txt \
  --voice narrator_ita=/audio/clear-italian-voice.wav \
  --voice-text narrator_ita="Questo racconto e' cresciuto..." \
  --voice-lang narrator_ita=italian
```

### Server options (all modalities)

These apply to every modality, before the subcommand:

- `host` / `port` — where to listen (`-i` / `-p`). In practice: set
  `--host 0.0.0.0` if you serve from inside a container, or the published
  port will not answer.
- `sessions` (`-j`) — preallocated GPU request sessions. In practice: more
  sessions means more requests can compute at once, at the cost of memory
  per session.
- `maxConnections` — maximum simultaneous HTTP connections. In practice:
  clients beyond the limit queue or are refused instead of piling up.
- `maxRequestBytes` — maximum request body size. In practice: matters mostly
  for ASR, since requests carry whole audio files (the audio benchmark used
  32 MiB).
- `apiKey` — if set, clients must present this key. In practice: minimal
  authentication for a home server.
- `verbose` — chattier logs.

## Commands

```text
gufo serve
gufo chat
gufo prompt
gufo eval
gufo bench
gufo video
gufo transcribe
gufo diagnose
```

`serve` starts the OpenAI-compatible server. `chat` maintains an interactive
conversation. `prompt` executes one request and exits. `eval` grades the pinned
DS4 capability questions through an already running OpenAI-compatible server.
`bench` measures model execution, `video` runs MiniMax H3 generation,
`transcribe` runs native Qwen3-ASR-1.7B speech recognition, and `diagnose` runs
non-interactive system and hardware diagnostics.

All commands support `--help` and `--version`. Unknown options and invalid
combinations return an error instead of being ignored.

### Server mode

Gufo can be run as a server exposing OpenAI-compatible API HTTP endpoints, activated based on the model served.

```sh
gufo serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 llm --model /models/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL.gguf
# or
gufo serve audio \
  --tts-model ./models/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base \
  --voice narrator_ita=./audio/clear-italian-voice.wav \
  --voice-text "narrator_ita=Questo racconto e' cresciuto..." \
  --voice narrator_eng=./audio/clear-english-voice.wav \
  --voice-text narrator_eng=./audio/clear-english-voice.txt
```

Several flags are offered by the command, they won't be documented here to avoid having the out of sync. If you need more information please use the help command

```sh
gufo serve --help
# or
gufo serve llm --help
```

### Diagnose

Gufo can self detect if everything is correctly configured to be able to run, such as drivers, groups, permissions, etc.

### Benchmarks and Evaluations

Two utilities are shipped with gufo to quickly verify the speed of a model (`bench`) and the accuracy of it (`eval`).
