# Benchmark methodology

Build with `nix build` and measure binaries under `result/bin`. Per-model
results and qualification gaps live in:

- [DeepSeek V4 Flash](models/deepseek-v4-flash/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [Qwen3.8 27B](models/qwen3.8-27b/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [Qwen3.8 Flash-Next](models/qwen3.8-flash-next/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [Qwen3-TTS](models/qwen3-tts/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [Qwen3-ASR](models/qwen3-asr/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [MiniMax H3](models/minimax-h3/BENCHMARKS.md)

## Direct and serving measurements

`gufo bench` measures the model path. Keep model artifact, prompt length,
generation length, context depth, speculative mode, and sampling controls
fixed when comparing runs. `pp2048` means 2,048 new prompt tokens; context
depth is separate from the amount of new prefill work.

`tools/serving/gufo-serving-bench.py` measures HTTP serving with synchronized
requests. It distinguishes server-stage prefill/decode throughput, scheduler
and client TTFT, token ITL, whole-request throughput, and aggregate concurrency
throughput. C1 serving and a direct single-user benchmark are comparable only
when prompt, cache state, sampling, speculation, and timed scope match.

Use `aggregate.output_tokens_per_second.overall` for corpus throughput:
delivered output tokens divided by the sum of measured round spans.
Per-round medians describe variation; they are not the corpus throughput.
`measuredSpanMs` excludes warmups and time between rounds.

`--endpoint-profile openai` supports other OpenAI-compatible servers. Missing
server-stage metrics remain null. `--reference-report` compares completion
hashes against an existing C1 reference; category filters select a focused
subset. Qualify acceptance with a fresh server so prompt-cache hits do not
hide work. See [serving benchmark commands](PERFORMANCE.md) for invocation.

`tools/bench/speculative-corpus.py` compares direct autoregressive and
speculative token traces. Request correctness, acceptance, and end-to-end
speed are separate requirements.

## Quality method (matched-token, per position)

Use the independent references and model-owned limits described in
[testing](TESTING.md). Tokenize once and feed teacher and candidate the same
predetermined history. Compare full next-token distributions before appending
the next evaluation token. Free-running text cannot isolate numerical error
after the first differing choice.

```text
p_t = softmax(teacher_logits)
p_c = softmax(candidate_logits)
KL  = sum_v p_t[v] * (log p_t[v] - log p_c[v])
NLL = -log(p_c[target_token])
```

Record non-finite counts, normalized-logit error, KL, teacher-token
NLL/perplexity, top-1 agreement, and top-k overlap as applicable. Aggregates
are over scored positions. A changed tokenizer, template, suite, or history
changes the comparison identity.

Capability evaluation is separate: [gufo eval](EVAL.md) grades free-running
answers through the OpenAI-compatible server.

## Focused kernel measurements

Build development tools with `cmake --preset gpu-test` and
`cmake --build --preset gpu-test --target gufo-kernel-bench tune_hipblaslt`.
They are omitted from the production package.

`gufo-kernel-bench` exercises production HIP entry points without loading a
model. Correctness sentinels run outside the timed interval:

```sh
./build/gpu-test/gufo-kernel-bench --help
./build/gpu-test/gufo-kernel-bench \
  --case decode-attention --context 4096,8192,12288,16384 \
  --warmup 5 --repetitions 30 --json
```

Standalone microbenchmarks under `tools/bench` and model-specific tool folders
report component correctness alongside timing. Their numbers do not replace
end-to-end model measurements. Collect profiler traces separately and use
[the performance guide](PERFORMANCE.md) to identify the limiting operation.

## Reporting and artifact retention

Record model/engine revisions, artifact hashes, hardware/software fingerprint,
input identity, context, output count, sampling, concurrency, cache state,
oracle identity, and the exact timed scope. A numerical mismatch or device
failure is not a passing result. Add repetitions when timing noise or a
suspected regression requires them.

Checked-in JSON retains fixtures, model provenance, controller calibration,
and bounded result summaries. Serving summaries preserve aggregate metrics,
per-case completion hashes, and the original report digest. Raw samples,
profiler traces, generated tuning databases, and full-logit captures stay in
ignored `artifacts/`, except for independent reference data needed by a
maintained correctness test.

Serving reports exclude endpoint hosts, prompts, generated text, model paths,
raw token IDs, and timestamps. The canonical machine fingerprint excludes
hostnames, usernames, secrets, timestamps, and private paths.
`gufo diagnose --validate-artifact` validates its supported diagnostic schema;
each model/tool owns the validation of its own result schema.

Downloaded tokenizer files and `.direnv` shell state are local artifacts.
Count tracked source, including HIP translation units, with:

```sh
nix run nixpkgs#cloc -- --vcs=git --force-lang=C++,hip
```
