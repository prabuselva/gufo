# Benchmark Methodology

How Strix benchmarks are computed, and which utilities produce them. This
file documents the method; per-model results live in `benchmarks/<model>/`
(readmes), never as raw committed artifacts (`artifacts/` is gitignored).
This method is teacher-forced and matched-token; it is not free-running
evaluation. Capability evaluation (free-running, answer-graded) is defined
in EVAL.md.

## Pipeline (tools/)

Benchmarks are the last step of the offline conversion toolchain. Each step
has one utility; a benchmark consumes the artifacts the earlier steps produce:

```bash
# 1. download safetensors + tokenizer -> artifacts/source
# 2. validate safetensors, write source manifest
tools/strix-inspect.py --source artifacts/source --revision <sha> \
  --out artifacts/work/source-manifest.json

# 3. capture full-precision teacher logits + perplexity (matched-token)
tools/strix-capture.py --source artifacts/source \
  --suite tools/suites/teacher.json --out artifacts/teacher

# 4. quantize LM linear projections to SHQ4-T16 U4Z G64
tools/strix-quantize.py --source artifacts/source \
  --out artifacts/quant --plan artifacts/work/quantization-plan.json

# 5. benchmark: candidate-vs-teacher quality + prefill/decode speed
tools/strix-bench.py --source artifacts/source --quant artifacts/quant \
  --suite tools/suites/teacher.json --teacher-artifact artifacts/teacher
```

Key utilities and their roles:

- `strix-capture.py` — teacher-forced full-precision logit dump. Logits are
  chunked by position, zstd-compressed, checksummed into an artifact dir
  (`manifest.json`, `tokens.u32`, `logits-*.f32.zst`, `metrics.json`).
  This is the teacher oracle; it is captured once and reused.
- `strix-quantize.py` — deterministic SHQ4 conversion. Records per-tensor
  reconstruction stats (max abs err, rmse, mean abs err) in the plan.
- `strix-bench.py` — the benchmark itself. Runs the candidate forward pass,
  compares candidate logits against the captured teacher artifact, and times
  prefill/decode on both.
- `tools/suites/<model>.json` — prompt suite (schema `strix.suite.v1`):
  a small fixed set of prompts, tokenized once with the pinned tokenizer.

## Quality method (matched-token, per position)

Per `docs/TESTING.md`: quantization comparisons are teacher forced, not
free-running. One tokenization; the same input prefix drives both teacher and
candidate; compare their full next-token distributions; append the
predetermined evaluation token, never each model's sampled token. This
isolates intrinsic quantization error from trajectory divergence.

For each prompt, at every position:

```text
p_t = softmax(z_t)   # teacher logits (captured artifact, f32)
p_c = softmax(z_c)   # candidate logits (forward run)
KL  = sum_v p_t[v] * (log p_t[v] - log p_c[v])
NLL = -log(p_c[target_token])
```

Aggregates over all scored positions (`quality.py`):

- KL: mean, median, p95, p99, p99.9, max
- teacher-token NLL and corpus perplexity
- top-1 agreement; top-5 / top-k set overlap
- candidate probability on the teacher top-1 token
- rank displacement of the teacher top-1 token
- max and RMS diff of normalized log probabilities
- count of non-finite values

Current slice reports mean/median/p95/p99/max KL, top-1 agreement, and
teacher + candidate perplexity.

### Position count and Artifact Schema

`positions` in a report equals the total number of scored next-token positions
across all suite prompts. The captured teacher logit artifact follows the
`strix.logit-artifact.v1` schema with chunked zstd compression, dynamic
vocabulary extraction for Qwen3.5-4B and Qwen3.8-27B, and SHA-256 chunk
manifest validation.

The committed suite identity is:

```text
tools/suites/teacher.json
sha256: b33862883e78e7500cc8553cffe68ec8c44ca5ac1ceca8cbccb3070f6d42b131
```

KL aggregates are computed over positions, not prompts. A changed suite hash or
position count creates a new benchmark identity and must not be compared as the
same run.

### Per-layer breakdown (planned)

The first slice measures whole-model, whole-prompt quality: one KL per scored
position, aggregated model-wide. It does not isolate which layer or tensor
contributes the KL tail. Per-layer and per-tensor attribution (layer-output
error, per-layer KL, first-divergent-layer search) is a planned refinement;
`strix-quantize.py` already records per-tensor reconstruction stats, and
`docs/TESTING.md` T3 documents layer-boundary capture. Imatrix search was
implemented before this planned prerequisite; per-layer attribution is now a
required catch-up gate before selecting the Qwen3.8-27B production recipe or
promoting native quantized kernels.

## Speed method (CPU reference runtime)

Speed is measured only after logits are comparable
(`docs/TESTING.md`: correctness before performance counts).

- Prefill: full-prompt forward (all suite prompts), summed tokens.
- Decode: single-token forward, repeated.
- Both teacher and candidate run through the same pinned torch reference path,
  timed with `time.perf_counter`, median of `--repeats` runs (default 2).

Important: candidate speed here is the reference runtime after
dequant-reload-to-bf16 — it measures SHQ4 dequant cost, not Strix kernels.
Real kernel speed (HIP gfx1151 / XDNA2 AIE2P consuming packed planes
directly) is a separate, later milestone. Kernel benchmarks will record the
backend and kernel name per timing row.

## Focused GPU kernel benchmarks

`strix-kernel-bench` measures production HIP entry points without loading a
model. It covers matrix operations, attention, DeltaNet, normalization, and
elementwise kernels. Correctness sentinels run outside the timed interval.

```sh
./result/bin/strix-kernel-bench --list
./result/bin/strix-kernel-bench \
  --case decode-attention \
  --context 4096,8192,12288,16384 \
  --warmup 5 \
  --repetitions 30 \
  --json
```

The JSON report records shapes, raw HIP-event samples, summary latency,
dispatch choices, and a privacy-safe machine fingerprint. Collect profiler
resource data in a separate `rocprofv3` pass.

`tune_hipblaslt` creates an optional hardware/ROCm-bound plan database.
`benchmark_ssm_replay` compares recurrent rollback at draft lengths 1-16.
Generated databases, traces, and replay reports are local artifacts and are
not committed. See [Performance Engineering](PERFORMANCE.md) for commands and
promotion rules.

## Machine Fingerprint & Artifact Binding

All diagnostic and benchmark artifacts must embed a canonical machine fingerprint
and its SHA-256 identifier (`fingerprintId`):

- **Canonical Identity**: Records pinned CPU topology, gfx1151 GPU identity/CUs,
  XDNA2 NPU identity, kernel drivers (`amdgpu`, `amdxdna`), ROCm/HIP, and XRT toolchain pins.
- **Privacy Redaction**: Hostnames, usernames, process secrets, timestamps, and local
  user paths are strictly excluded from the canonical identity and forbidden in benchmark artifacts.
- **Validation**: Artifacts can be validated with `strix-server diagnose --validate-artifact <path>`,
  which checks schema compliance (`schemaVersion: 1.0.0`), re-hashes canonical fields,
  and rejects mismatched fingerprints or incompatible architectures.

## Reporting rules

Every report records, at minimum:

- Machine `fingerprintId` referencing the canonical machine fingerprint.
- Source repo + immutable revision, source storage dtype (bf16), accumulation
  contract.
- Candidate: which tensors quantized, the SHQ4 scheme (T16, U4Z, group size),
  tensor count, artifact size.
- Suite hash and scored position count.
- Oracle runtime and version.
- `--json` output is machine-readable; human form prints speed then quality.

A benchmark result is only comparable against another result with the same
machine fingerprint, source revision, suite, tokenizer, and reference runtime. Do not average
numbers across revisions or suites.
