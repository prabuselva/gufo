# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next experiments

| Experiment | Decision / evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Full-width MTP RMSNorm and split projection | Retained after independent CPU stage audit; one 10240-wide normalization, embedding projection shared across HC branches. |
| Full Q8 vocabulary head | Retained; private Q4 shortlist removed. Sampled top-64 proposals use exact target verification. |
| Batched MTP transformer and heads | Retained; independent body/head comparisons, private KV/recurrent/rollback/RNG state. |
| Batched decode mixers, residual epilogues and MTP norms | Retained; each request keeps its scalar reduction and private state; exact C2/C4/C6/C8 logits, acceptance and RNG. |
| HC Q8 weight prefetch | Retained for 1–8 rows of the 320×10240 projection; exact original products/FMA order, no extra allocation. |
| Q4 shared-expert weight reuse | Retained with a separate compact kernel for single-request experts; faster repetitive C1/C4/C8, no mixed-work regression, exact projection/model replay. |
| Q5 high-bit expansion | Retained; exact integer multiply/mask replaces repeated shifts, with unchanged dot products and faster serving. |
| Short convolution/history fusion | Retained for 1–8 tokens; exact output, rolling state and rollback snapshots, fewer launches and no additional allocation. |
| Batched GDN recurrence | Retained; private ragged state/rollback rows, cancellation isolation and exact session replay. Helps shallow batches most; end-to-end gains are modest. |
| Batched small projections and MoE preparation | Retained; group independent rows, quantize activations once in existing scratch, and batch router/shared-expert work. Exact scalar/batch outputs and sampled state; C1 unchanged. |
| Q4 expert grouping across the full batch | Retained; bounded groups share weights across request boundaries, with original scalar arithmetic and exact session replay. Q5 down grouping was slower on mixed routing and was rejected. |
| Register-cached vision softmax | Retained for bounded row sizes; unchanged reduction order, byte-identical Flash-Next/Qwen27B embeddings, no additional allocation. |
| 4096-patch vision attention tiles | Retained; byte-identical GEMMs/embeddings, lower latency and 24 MiB less attention scratch. Other shapes keep their original tiles. |
| Partitioned BF16 WMMA vision value projection | Rejected: failed the full-encoder reference gate despite lower isolated FP64 error. |
| Integer WMMA Q8 verification | Retained for 9–32 input rows of wide target projections/heads; preserves K8 partials/FMA order and reduces each result once, with exact session replay. Small batches retain vector kernels. |
| Q8 activation reuse across output rows | Rejected: no repeatable gain on the real projection shapes. |
| Wider Q8 decode and Q5 expert tiles | Rejected: exact output, but 33–64 dense rows and 16/32 expert rows were slower on representative shared/distinct/mixed work. |
| Compact expert launch groups | Rejected: improved shared routing but negligible mixed-routing gain. |
| Sparse attention register/cache retuning | Rejected: exact d128K output, but register scheduling/occupancy gave no material gain and reloading queries was slower. |
| FP32 selector load scheduling | Retained; bounded scheduling removes scalar-register spills, preserves every score bit and lowers d32K selection time to 22.4 ms per pp2048. Matched d128K AR prefill improves about 1.5%. |
| Integer WMMA value transpose and paired FP32 selector lanes | Rejected: bit-preserving transpose and exact selector scores, but both were slower on deep-context inputs. |
| Packed Q8 prefill staging | Rejected: exact output, but extra decode/register/transpose costs outweighed reduced LDS use. |
| Transient F16 SSM weights and parallel HC branches | Rejected: F16 staging was exact but slower overall; parallel HC branches changed quantization ties. |
| Smaller-LDS SSM projection and unrolled HC expert sum | Rejected: exact output but no prefill speed gain. |
| Transient key transpose and mixed expert tiles | Rejected: exact outputs; key transpose slows deep selection, mixed tile sizes provide no useful prefill gain. |
| Query sharing, query LDS caching, MoE prefetch barriers/unrolling | Rejected: exact outputs, but no useful speed gain. Four-wave Q8 matrix reduction also lost to eight waves. |
| Ratio-four predictor QSA, FP32 ranking queries | Retained with sparse state, rewind and deep selector checks. |
| Greedy batch cost controller | Retained only for all-greedy C>1; separate occupancy/context bins, stable plain controls, no transition timings. Sampled replay uses fixed curves calibrated from median warmed cycles on 2026-09-20. |
| One-row MTP prefill lag | Retained; 320 KiB kept hidden state/session, avoids replaying a final prefill chunk. |
| Lazy rollback and shared scratch | Retained; depth grows on demand, reset releases it; seven-draft cap about 788 MiB/session. |
| Live final frontier and async prompt snapshots | Retained; immutable branch snapshot, worker capture, bounded persistence outside the lookup lock. |
| Chunk-equivalent projections/attention | Retained with exact continued-image/cache/full-logit gates; one-token tails keep prefill arithmetic. |
| More Q8 vocabulary rows/block | Rejected: no C1 improvement. |

Separate d32K pp2048 profiling attributes 29.1% of kernel time to MoE, 34.9%
to dense projections and 12.6% to attention/indexing. A C4 mixed MTP trace is
80.7% GPU-busy; MoE/MMQ is 51.3% and dense projections 36.1% of kernel time.
These are profile observations, not unprofiled throughput measurements.

Next: improve prefill at depth and target/draft batch projection reuse while
preserving [quality](EVALUATION.md). The 1700 tok/s PP and flat d0–d128K
objectives remain unmet; see [current benchmarks](BENCHMARKS.md).
