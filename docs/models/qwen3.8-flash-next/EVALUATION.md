# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next evaluation

Text/MTP operator and execution-consistency checks pass. **Original unquantized-model
and GGUF-conversion parity remain unqualified.** The independent vision check
below still exceeds its tolerance. Qualification dates: September 20–23, 2026.

## Quality results

| Area | Retained evidence |
| --- | --- |
| MTP predictor | Eight text/image states audited against scalar CPU operators using original GGUF weights. Fusion/attention relative RMS <0.0008; gate 0.002. Checks cover full-width 10,240-value RMSNorm, split projections, recursive carry, text-only shifted inputs, full Q8 head, and serial/batched/headless catch-up. Norm tolerance: 2e-6; MoE/head: 5e-5. |
| Sampling | AR and MTP verification share FP64 target filtering, normalization and CDFs, with 53-bit target RNG. Tests cover top-p/min-p boundaries, p/q acceptance, residual correction and seeded replay. Proposals use the full head's top 64 logits; upstream draft-sampler equivalence is not claimed. |
| Batching and kernels | C2/C4/C6/C8 retain logits, tokens, acceptance, residual draws and RNG with ragged budgets and every 1–8-token rollback prefix. Q4/Q8 projection and GDN rollback controls retain FP32 bytes; sparse rankings/masks match through 128K. |
| Prefill | Chunk-boundary checks cover 1/8/9/32/33-token tails through 4096 tokens. The 2176-token scalar/prefill control retains top-1 with logit RMSE 0.18. |
| Sessions and serving | AR/MTP cancellation, third-turn continuation, reasoning removal/preservation, concurrent image/text isolation and disk restart pass. A 4095-token snapshot check covers mid-decode save, ring wrap, pending MTP state and RNG. |
| HTTP corpus | All 63 Gufo tg128 requests (21 AR, 21 mixed MTP, 21 repetitive MTP) match independent fresh-prefill AR hashes. Prepared sessions reuse every prompt token. These are text-consistency checks, not original-model accuracy. |
| Vision optimizations | Complete 256×256/1024×1024 embeddings and a 736×736 ragged control retain native output bytes. Independent upstream parity has the gap below. |

**Vision:** Gufo exceeds one encoder parity gate: a 1024×1024 synthetic texture
produces 6.47% embedding relative L2 error versus official Transformers BF16
operators (limit: 5%). Both use the same converted GGUF weights; **llama.cpp
was not tested**. Against the FP32 control, Gufo and Transformers BF16 differ
by 7.83% and 8.10%, respectively. This measures numerical drift, not image-answer
accuracy. [Retained evidence](artifacts/vision-parity.json) ·
[Reproduction](../qwen3.8-27b/EVALUATION.md#vision).

Pinned Transformers ignores MTP weights. Seeded
replay requires the same build, seed, request budget, capacity and sampling
settings; sampled MTP need not match AR's same-seed sequence. Greedy output
must remain independent of draft width and batching.

## Maintained checks

Tests live in `tests/models/qwen38_flash_next/`; run only the affected check.

| Target / mode | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `qwen38_flash_next_tests` | Operator, configuration and I/O checks: scalar/FP64 references, malformed metadata, unsupported geometry and sidecar compatibility. |
| `qwen38_flash_next_session_test --batch-only` | Independent logits/state/RNG at C2/C4/C6/C8, rollback, cancellation and images. |
| `qwen38_flash_next_session_test --sampling-only` | 23 AR/MTP sampling configurations, penalties, residual correction and short budgets. |
| `qwen38_flash_next_session_test --prefill-only` | Full logits across chunk boundaries and short tails. |
| `qwen38_flash_next_snapshot_test` | Persistence, image attachment and continuation replay; AR/MTP states cannot cross modes. |
| `qwen38_flash_next_gpu_probe --mtp-audit` | Original encoded weights and scalar predictor stages; add `--batch 2048` for ragged/aligned catch-up. |

Build the required targets with Nix, for example:

```sh
nix develop -c cmake --build --preset gpu-test \
  --target qwen38_flash_next_model_tests qwen38_flash_next_gpu_probe
PROBES=build/gpu-test/tests/models/qwen38_flash_next
nix develop -c "$PROBES/qwen38_flash_next_gpu_probe" \
  --model "$MODEL" --mtp-model "$MTP" --mtp-audit
```

Operator tests can be selected with CTest, for example
`-R 'qwen38_flash_next[.]select_ops' --no-tests=error --output-on-failure`.
The GPU probe's `--cost-audit C --depth N` measures predictor/verification costs;
`C=0` selects C1/C2/C4/C6/C8. Performance uses Nix release binaries and the
[profiling workflow](../../PERFORMANCE.md), separately from correctness runs.

## Benchmark method

The [card](BENCHMARKS.md) refreshes Gufo single-user MTP, both engines’
concurrency/loading and reference MTP at 64K/128K on September 23 (UTC);
other values remain from September 22.
One qualified sample per point; concurrency sums individual decode rates.
Versions and commands are in [model identities](artifacts/model-identities.json)
and the table artifacts.

Single-user rows use approximately pp2048/tg128, greedy, thinking off.
Each mode generates its own eight-token reply before the measured continuation.
Depth/prefill tolerance is max(32 tokens, 0.5%). Gufo capacity is 133760;
reference AR uses 35456 through 32K, 68224 at 64K and 133760 at 128K.
Reference MTP uses the same capacities as AR. All four refreshed 64K/128K
workload points generated 128 tokens with valid prefix/prefill counts. Prefix
setup and timed requests had zero disk reads and major page faults; the 120 GiB
cgroup and 3 GiB host-memory guard did not interrupt any run. At 128K, the two
workloads share one warmed server and reset to the prefix before each measurement.
MTP pp takes each engine's maximum across mixed/repetitive workloads.
AR reference: `b11069`; MTP: pinned
`llama-server-mtp` at `6fcaa16f` ([upstream change](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/28243)).

Concurrency uses the **same pp2048 d0 prompts**: prose for AR/mixed MTP,
passage-copying for repetitive MTP, tg128, context 4096 per user. Every user
receives the same prompt; servers are fresh per C1/C2/C4/C6/C8. All sessions
finish a one-token preparation request before the timed tg128 cohort repeats
those prompts with caching enabled. llama.cpp slots are pinned; at most four
final prompt tokens may be reevaluated. This excludes peers' long prefills from
llama.cpp's elapsed generation clock; Gufo reports active decode time.
The reference clock can still include interference from the four-token tail.
Gufo MTP d0/C1 rates agree within 0.4%, with matching completions and draft counts.
llama.cpp's mixed-MTP completions vary with concurrency; the artifacts retain their hashes.
Gufo completions must match the fresh AR controls in
`multi-{mixed,repetition}-gufo-ar.json`. Refresh those when prompts, arithmetic,
weights or tokenizer change. Cross-engine agreement is not an accuracy score.

Loading uses C1/MTP/capacity 262144, from cold model files to HTTP readiness.
`POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` plus `mincore` verified zero resident pages for all four
target shards and the sidecar. The reference ran inside a 120 GiB memory
cgroup with a 3 GiB host-availability floor; neither limit interrupted startup.
Readiness does not qualify a filled 262K context.
Memory uses C1 AR at capacity 133121, sampling global HIP allocation every
250 ms including 2.38 GiB idle allocation.

`artifacts/bench.json` declares six tables.
Run `tools/bench/model-bench.py --model qwen3.8-flash-next render` through Nix to
regenerate the card without model execution. Measurement commands and scoped
quality controls are in the [benchmark workflow](../../../.agents/skills/benchmark-model/SKILL.md).
