# Qwen3.8 27B experiments

| Experiment | Decision / qualification |
| --- | --- |
| Quantized verification row groups | Retained per shape; scalar FP32 bits, full target logits and private acceptance/RNG must match. |
| Shared DFlash2 body/context injection | Retained across requests; independent attention, convolution, history and selector state. |
| Partial verification after rejection | Retained with the complete original proposal and unchanged consumed-prefix feedback. |
| BF16 draft gate/up reuse and tiled argmax | Retained; complete head, finite filtering and lowest-ID ties; no extra persistent buffer. |
| Long-context KV packing | Retained in idle FFN scratch with bounded head groups; exact attention output/log-sum-exp, cache bytes unchanged. |
| BF16 target projection reduction | Fixed per-row FP32 order retained for chunk/cache/continued-image equivalence. |
| Register-cached vision softmax | Retained; byte-identical embeddings with the shared Q4/Q8 projector, unchanged reduction order and memory allocation. |
| 4096-patch vision attention tiles | Retained; byte-identical full embeddings, lower latency and 24 MiB less attention scratch. |
| Alternate tiles/waves/pipeline depths (2026-09-19) | Rejected: no release throughput improvement. |
| Dynamic verification chunk/controller alternatives | No new default retained; seeded private-acceptance policy remains. |
| Parallel mapped-weight reads and larger DFlash packing chunks | Retained: faster cold startup, unchanged encoded weights. |
| Compact active/saved recurrence and valid-prefix KV | Retained: unused attention-layer state and future KV rows excluded; Q4/Q8 sampling, rollback, image and disk replay pass. |

Priorities: C2/C4/C6/C8 generation and deep-context prefill, with C1 regression
controls. Optimize all three draft precisions before a full recommendation.
Published workload numbers live only in [benchmarks](BENCHMARKS.md); source and
model qualification live in [evaluation](EVALUATION.md).
