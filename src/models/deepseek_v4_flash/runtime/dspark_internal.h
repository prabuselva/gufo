/*
 * DeepSeek V4 Flash DSpark support model.
 *
 * DSpark is DeepSeek's own speculative drafter for this checkpoint. It is a
 * separate GGUF holding a short stack of full DS4 blocks (MLA attention, routed
 * MoE, hyper-connections) plus a low-rank Markov path selector. The support
 * artifact also carries a confidence head for format compatibility, but the
 * retained fixed-block scheduler does not evaluate it. DSpark is unrelated to
 * the Qwen DFlash and DFlash-2 drafters, which use block diffusion over a
 * single fused draft layer.
 *
 * One draft pass proposes a whole block of `block_size` tokens:
 *
 *   1. Feature injection - the target's hidden states at `target_layer_ids` are
 *      concatenated, projected by `main_proj`, normalized by `main_norm`, and
 *      turned into per-stage KV rows. This is what lets a three-block drafter
 *      track a forty-three-block target.
 *   2. Non-causal block attention - the block enters as
 *      [last_committed_token, MASK, MASK, ...] embedded with the target's tied
 *      token embeddings. Every block row attends to the injected KV *and* to
 *      all other block rows, so the whole block is produced by one forward
 *      pass instead of `block_size` sequential steps.
 *   3. Path selection - base logits come from the target LM head; the Markov
 *      head then adds W2 * W1[previous token] so the block follows one
 *      coherent trajectory rather than independent per-position argmaxes.
