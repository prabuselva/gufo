# Optimize gfx1151 kernels

Read the affected model's `docs/models/<model>/{BENCHMARKS,EVALUATION,EXPERIMENTS}.md`
and its launch code. Establish the timed scope and arithmetic contract before
changing dispatch. Follow the user's machine, time, and Git instructions.

## Fast experiment loop

1. Keep baseline and candidate production binaries. Use `nix build`, or the
   `release` CMake preset with the same compiler/dependency versions. Test
   binaries keep assertions and are for correctness, not headline timings.
2. Start with one affected shape and one control. Use pp2048/tg128 for retained
   end-to-end results; tiny prompts/outputs suffice to debug launches. For a
   depth issue, try d16K/d32K first. Expand to d64K/d128K only when justified.
3. Profile separately with `tools/prof/prof.py`; compare stage totals, launch
   counts, GPU-busy time and wall span. Inspect allocator, synchronization,
   sampling and cache I/O when GPU time does not explain latency.
   Warm each batch shape before calibration: large lazy allocations caused
   100 ms stalls here. Use a median complete cycle when timings remain noisy.
4. Change one mechanism, compile the affected target, then run its existing
   analytic/operator check. Use `tools/bench/build.sh <name>` for standalone
   HIP experiments; each result needs correctness alongside throughput.
5. Compare unprofiled baseline/candidate under identical model, prompt, depth,
   quantization, sampling, cache history and concurrency. Repeat only to resolve
   noise. A microbenchmark gain must survive the full inference path.
6. Keep the winning implementation as default. Delete rejected/dead routes;
   do not add environment switches or duplicate tests to preserve experiments.
   Record one concise retained/rejected row in `EXPERIMENTS.md`, current speeds
   in `BENCHMARKS.md`, and actual quality evidence in `EVALUATION.md`.

## Techniques that worked here

- **Bandwidth and cache:** measure `tools/bench/gfx1151_peak.hip`, not a spec
  sheet. Previous large-buffer controls reached roughly 240 GB/s. The 32 MiB
  MALL cache can make repeatedly reused small matrices look unrealistically
  fast: rotate weights beyond cache capacity or reproduce full-model traffic.
- **GEMV:** coalesce packed weight loads, stage shared activations in LDS,
  fuse QKV or gate/up reads where useful, and preserve each dot product's
  accumulation order. More fusion can increase VGPR pressure and spills.
  Two-iteration prefetch helped the small 320×10240 HC projection; wider
  prefetch and applying it to larger matrices did not. Preserve the actual
  rounded products/FMA sequence, not just the algebraic formula.
  Integer WMMA helped wider Q8 verification only after retaining four K8
  partials and the original reduction tree. Reducing one result per thread
  avoided duplicate wave sums. DPP xor/add helped GDN; fewer waves or smaller
  scratch alone did not help.
  Repeat identical inputs at different tile columns: fast-math gave routed
  Q8 minitiles different contraction until the product/FMA order was explicit.
- **Verification and concurrency:** reuse quantized weights across token and
  request rows. Tune real ragged shapes, including 3–8 rows and partial tiles.
  Batch the complete draft transformer body, not only the vocabulary head;
  keep each request's KV, recurrence, acceptance and RNG state independent.
  A request dimension in GDN's grid reduced launch overhead for shallow
  verification. Use disjoint scratch and rollback pointers, skip cancelled
  rows before touching state, and keep descriptor storage alive until completion.
  Test both shared and disjoint expert routing: weight reuse benefits shared
  experts, but single-request experts need a compact path.
  Group independent small projections in the launch grid and quantize batch
  activations once in idle prefill scratch. Preserve each row's original
  dot-product specialization; larger generic GEMV tiles can be slower.
  For Q4 experts, grouping across the full batch improved weight reuse.
  A bounded grid can consume a compact device list without downloading its
  count. Qualify disjoint routing too; the same approach slowed Q5 mixed work.
  Exact packed-integer transforms can help both: spreading Q5 high-bit
  nibbles with multiply/mask removed shifts without changing dequantization.
- **Wave mode and compiler:** selected quantized kernels need wave64 while
  other paths use wave32. Match helper/caller wave modes per translation unit.
  Iterative ILP scheduling helped selected 16-row Q4/Q5 kernels; applying it
  globally was not a win. Inspect VGPR/LDS/private scratch and ISA with
  `tools/prof/isa_mix.py`; occupancy alone is not the optimization objective.
  For wide register-cached softmax, a scheduling barrier after each exponential
  removed spills while preserving the sum order. Cache only bounded row sizes.
  FP32 selector queries also benefited from bounded load scheduling: grouping
  16 dot-product chains removed scalar-register spills without changing scores.
  Verify generated register use and full-model time; barriers elsewhere lost.
- **Attention and selection:** exact partial top-k can avoid sorting the full
  context. Preserve tie ordering and FP32 ranking. Pack existing KV bytes into
  bounded scratch/head groups without changing persistent precision. Do not
  change softmax reduction order without the model's numerical qualification.
  Smaller vision attention tiles saved scratch and time at 4096 patches;
  ragged BLAS tails changed rounding. Qualify complete GEMM/encoder outputs
  and specialize only the shapes that retain both quality and speed.
- **Fusion and memory:** split repeated embedding/hidden projections instead
  of concatenating duplicate inputs. Respect full-width HC normalization.
  Reuse scratch, allocate rollback depth on demand, and avoid carrying entire
  prefill chunks into draft catch-up. Fuse short convolution/history saves
  while values are in registers; require one owner per channel so another
  token tile cannot overwrite history still being read. UMA has placement
  costs: mapped quantized weights and copied reusable audio/DiT weights behave
  differently.
- **Graphs:** verify replay actually launches every new operation. Side-stream
  work during capture is not automatically included in the graph. Check the
  relevant shallow/deep dispatch boundaries and unprofiled wall time.

## Quality and reporting

Use an independent operator formula or pinned official teacher; two Gufo
paths agreeing does not prove upstream parity. Compare matched token histories
and find the first changed layer if logits drift. Never relax tolerances or
replace goldens to accept a speedup. Test finite outputs and awkward tails
(e.g. 1/8/9/32/33 rows), not only aligned shapes. End ragged inputs at the
allocation boundary; oversized shared scratch can conceal invalid reads.
Moving FP32 expressions into a device helper changed contraction here.
Capture the first failing operator's inputs for a small replay; include
unsaturated activations, since large synthetic values can hide the difference.

For state or speculative changes, cover greedy output, sampled p/q rejection
and residual correction, seeded replay, EOS, multi-turn continuation and
snapshot restore. Add images/cancellation when those paths change. Timing-based
controllers are for greedy decoding; sampled execution must retain seeded
replay. Full model sweeps are final qualification, not each iteration.

Measure C1 plus affected C2/C4/C6/C8. Keep prompt and cache state identical when
comparing CLI single-user and HTTP C1; report decode rate separately from whole
request throughput. Raise the benchmark server's per-client queue limit for
C8 from one host; a rejected request is not a throughput result. For H3,
prefer an analytic case or one block/forward pass;
do not generate full videos during routine kernel work.
