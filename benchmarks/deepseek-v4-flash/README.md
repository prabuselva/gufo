# DeepSeek V4 Flash Q2-imatrix on Strix Halo

Status: 2026-08-30. This page is the current functional and performance
snapshot, not an optimization history.

## Model

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `antirez/deepseek-v4-gguf` |
| Snapshot | `1cd7b564460821938add0475a60b942c409295e0` |
| Artifact | `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf` |
| Size | 80.76 GiB |
| Engine source | `antirez/ds4` at `84cc882352757baf628a1776badf7cc54d584e28` |
| Backend | Model-private ROCm/HIP implementation for `gfx1151` |

The DeepSeek graph, quantized layouts, session state, dispatch, and numerical
kernels live under `src/models/deepseek_v4_flash`. They do not call Qwen
kernels or share mutable Qwen state.

## Run

Build through the repository flake and define the artifact path:

```sh
git add .
nix build

MODEL=/path/to/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf
```

Run a terminal prompt:

```sh
./result/bin/gufo prompt \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --raw \
  --prompt 'The capital of France is' \
  -n 16 \
  -t 0
```

Run the sparse long-context benchmark. Each prompt row adds a 2K suffix to the
prepared depth, and each generation row produces 128 autoregressive tokens.
Frontiers are extended incrementally and restored from in-memory snapshots.

```sh
./result/bin/gufo bench \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --n-prompt 2048 \
  --n-gen 128 \
  --n-depth 2048,8192,16384,32768,65536 \
  --repetitions 1 \
  --verbose
```

The same artifact can be served through the existing OpenAI-compatible
completion and chat endpoints:

```sh
./result/bin/gufo serve \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  llm \
  --model "$MODEL"
```

The retained first-four Antirez DS4 HTTP capability run and independent repeat
are documented in [eval/README.md](eval/README.md). They are Gufo regression
baselines, not official dataset scores.

## Current Results

The Gufo rows use the release package, one repetition, a 2K prompt suffix, and
128 generated tokens. The DS4 reference is the supplied same-machine result
for the same artifact. Prompt rows compare the final context after adding the
2K suffix; generation rows compare the prepared depth.

| Prepared depth | Gufo `pp2048` | DS4 `pp2048` | Delta | Gufo `tg128` | DS4 `tg128` | Delta | Snapshot bytes |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2K | 206.33 | 205.49 | +0.4% | 15.63 | 14.76 | +5.9% | 52,184,460 |
| 8K | 204.22 | 197.13 | +3.6% | 14.65 | 13.87 | +5.6% | 136,750,476 |
| 16K | 197.79 | 190.09 | +4.1% | 14.39 | 13.63 | +5.6% | 249,505,164 |
| 32K | 179.18 | 171.83 | +4.3% | 13.66 | 12.93 | +5.6% | 475,014,540 |
| 64K | not remeasured | not supplied | - | 12.42 | 11.91 | +4.3% | 926,033,292 |

The model loads 80.76 GiB of tensor spans in about 21 seconds. The 64K run
plans 82.07 GiB total, including model, KV state, and working buffers.
The 2K decode value was confirmed by two paired candidate samples; the 8K-32K
rows come from one sparse-depth sweep. The 64K
prompt row was not rerun because the retained prompt-kernel gain was already
stable through 32K.

### Weight placement

DS4 keeps the copied device-arena policy. A source-selected candidate instead
registered the full read-only GGUF mapping with HIP and addressed weights
through its device alias. Separate release packages used the same artifact,
kernel routes, 2K prepared depth, 2K prompt, and 128 generated tokens.

| Policy | Cache state | Load | `pp2048` | `tg128` | Max RSS |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HIP-mapped GGUF | cold | 23.19 s | 64.70 tok/s | 14.15 tok/s | 81.20 GiB |
| HIP-mapped GGUF | warm | 2.49 s | 153.63 tok/s | 8.93 tok/s | 81.23 GiB |
| Copied device arenas | interleaved repeat | 23.11 s | 205.64 tok/s | 15.47 tok/s | 0.72 GiB |

Even with the file cache warm, direct mapping regressed prompt throughput by
25.3% and generation throughput by 42.3%. It also added about 80.5 GiB of
process RSS and roughly 21.25 million minor faults because registration
first-touched the complete mapping. The mapped candidate passed the unchanged
quality envelope exactly: pinned trajectory 116/128 top-1, rank sum 142,
worst rank 3; batched-prefill RMSE 0.478146, cosine 0.99617, maximum error
2.39995, and sequential choice rank 1. The candidate was therefore rejected
for placement performance and memory behavior, not numerical quality.

A separate full-prompt comparison isolates the retained prompt kernels:

| Prompt | Baseline | Current | Delta |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4K | 194.31 | 202.15 | +4.0% |
| 8K | 203.54 | 209.01 | +2.7% |
| 16K | 203.75 | 210.02 | +3.1% |

The 4K values are means from an interleaved baseline/candidate replay. The 8K
and 16K values are matched release-package runs. The current paired attention
route keeps FP32 compressed KV authoritative and maintains a derived FP16 mirror
for ratio-4 attention layers. Indexed-attention time falls from 82.07 ms to
55.72 ms per layer (-32.1%); fused mirror production adds 0.22 ms total. The
wave32 kernel uses 80 VGPRs, 57,992 bytes LDS, zero scratch, and 32 waves per
workgroup. The mirror adds about 21, 42, 84, 168, and 336 MiB at 4K, 8K, 16K,
32K, and 64K respectively, while snapshot payloads remain unchanged.

### Resident server scheduling

The OpenAI-compatible server keeps independent DeepSeek sessions resident in
the common text scheduler. DeepSeek currently advertises physical width one,
so C=2 and C=4 requests make fair round-robin progress through an exact serial
fallback rather than a native batched decode kernel.

Release-package qualification used distinct raw prompts, 16 greedy output
tokens per request, a 512-token context, and isolated replays of every
concurrent request:

| Workload | Decode rate after TTFT | Whole-request aggregate | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| C=1 | 16.47 tok/s | 11.50-11.53 tok/s | +1.3% decode rate against the prior 16.25 tok/s baseline |
| C=2 | Width-one serialized | 11.18-11.20 tok/s | Both outputs exactly match isolated execution |
| C=4 | Width-one serialized | 11.21-11.22 tok/s | All outputs exactly match isolated execution |

The C=1 decode rate is the reciprocal of the 60.73 ms median inter-token
latency across four steady samples after graph warmup. It is the number
comparable to `tg` throughput and is consistent with the 15-16 tok/s
longer-context results above. The previous direct-server baseline had a
61.54 ms steady inter-token latency, or 16.25 tok/s.

The 11.x tok/s values are a different metric: generated tokens divided by
whole HTTP wall time, including roughly 477-532 ms of prompt prefill per short
request. The C=2 and C=4 rows are two steady concurrent samples after graph
warmup. They are useful end-to-end workload measurements, but must not be
reported as DeepSeek decode or `tg` throughput.

Whole-request aggregate throughput does not yet scale with concurrency because
every physical model advance remains width one; the current benefit is
resident state, overlap, fair scheduling, cancellation, and prefix reuse
without reloading the model.

Clean server startup measurements reported about 89.4, 90.0, and 90.2 GiB of
consumed system-available memory at C=1, C=2, and C=4 respectively. Thus the
incremental resident-session cost was about 0.60 GiB at C=2 and 0.82 GiB at
C=4 relative to C=1, while the 80.76 GiB model tensor cache remained shared.
A short 20-token state snapshot contained 14.1 MiB after prefill and 15.2 MiB
after generation.

## Quality and Integration

- The pinned upstream DS4 CLI and packaged Gufo CLI produce the exact same
  four-token greedy continuation, ` Paris. It is`, for the same raw prompt and
  artifact.
- A pinned 128-token teacher-forced trajectory keeps at least 116/128 reference
  tokens at top-1, every reference token within top-3, and aggregate rank at
  most 142. This catches sustained numerical drift without treating
  free-running near-tie flips as state corruption.
- A 273-token batched-prefill versus sequential-state comparison matches the
  immutable pre-optimization envelope: RMSE at most 1.12, cosine at least
  0.979, maximum logit error at most 5.0, and the sequential winner remains
  within the batched top-3.
- Full logits are finite after real GGUF prefill.
- Snapshot restore reproduces the exact position, greedy token, and logit
  vector.
- Direct model sessions and the HTTP backend produce identical raw and chat
  token sequences.
- Cancellation returns the request session cleanly for exact subsequent reuse.
- Terminal prompt, benchmark, raw completion, and chat completion use the same
  model-owned engine and tokenizer.

## Successful

- Adapted the required DS4 graph and ROCm kernels into repository-owned C++20
  `runtime` and `kernels/rocm` packages.
- Removed standalone distributed, tensor-parallel, SSD weight streaming,
  multi-GPU placement, CPU reference, MTP, steering, and embedded hotlist
  implementations from the production closure.
- Converted the private fork to native ROCm/HIP naming and APIs.
- Kept DeepSeek code, kernels, state, and dispatch isolated from Qwen.
- Reused the existing Gufo CLI, benchmark, and OpenAI-compatible server.
- Matched the DS4 state payload sizes and stayed close to or ahead of the
  supplied throughput curve through 64K.
- Reduced the six-expert Q2-down kernel by 7.8% with a two-way compiler unroll;
  `tg128` improved 1.2% at 2K and 0.6-0.7% at 8K-32K without changing VGPR,
  LDS, or scratch allocation.
- Reused each routed-MoE activation tile across four Q2-down output fragments
  and aliased the epilogue over dead staging LDS. Full-prompt throughput improves
  1.1-2.7%, while the canonical 2K-suffix prompt rows improve about 4-5%
  through 32K.
- Added a derived FP16 compressed-KV mirror and 32-head wave32 indexed-attention
  route for large prompt batches. Full-prompt throughput improves 2.7-4.0% and
  canonical 2K-suffix prompt rows improve 2.4-3.3% through 32K, with neutral
  autoregressive throughput and unchanged serialized state.

## Failed

- Automatic CMake discovery was not reliable for the header-only ROCm
  dependencies in a clean Nix sandbox. Explicit flake-provided include roots
  are retained.
- The upstream DS4 frontend build is not imported. Gufo owns CLI, HTTP,
  benchmarking, cancellation, and session pooling.
- Q8 projection row grouping (`1/2/4/8`) and high-compression row grouping
  (`8/16/32`) produced no repeatable end-to-end improvement.
- Q2-down LDS aliasing alone was noise (`192.01` versus `192.13 tok/s` at
  4K); it is retained only because it enables the faster four-fragment kernel.
- An 8K prefill capacity regressed the 8K prompt (`201.80` versus `210.21
  tok/s`) and was noise in a 16K replay (`204.14` versus `203.62 tok/s`), so
  the existing 4K chunk policy remains.
- Wave32 indexed attention against the FP32 compressed cache was slower on its
  own (`193.49` versus `195.73 tok/s` at 4K); the route is retained only with
  fused production of the derived FP16 mirror.
- Native MMQ, device expert queues, cached hipBLASLt projection routing, and
  dense-Q8 32/128-token tile variants either failed the quality envelope or
  regressed the 4K prompt and were removed.
- Direct HIP registration of the full GGUF mapping was numerically valid but,
  even warm, regressed 2K prompt/decode throughput by 25.3%/42.3% and added
  about 80.5 GiB of process RSS, so copied device arenas remain authoritative.

## To Do

- Add model-owned thinking/reasoning mode and effort controls; the current chat
  template intentionally uses the no-thinking path.
- Retain and compare the first four-case `gufo eval` HTTP regression baseline;
  Pi/coding-agent evaluation remains deferred under #153.
- Profile and optimize the model-owned gfx1151 kernels under #155.
- Continue improving general-workload DSpark acceptance and verifier cost under
  #156 and #222. The retained fast route exceeds the 24--25 tok/s target on
  sustained high-acceptance decoding; see "DSpark speculative decoding" below.
- Add model-owned offline calibration/imatrix tooling only when a new
  quantization recipe requires it.
- Add native concurrent decode batching and restart-safe SSD state reuse
  through the serving milestones.

## DSpark speculative decoding (September 1, 2026)

Status: retained as an opt-in DS4-only backend under #156. Qwen continues to use
DFlash2; DSpark is not a replacement for the Qwen backend.

The optimized route seeds each five-token support-model block with the target's
already-known first token and verifies six rows. Four verifier-prefix snapshots
allow partial accepts to commit without replay. If five rows are accepted before
the sixth rejects, the runtime restores prefix four and evaluates only row five.
If a prefix snapshot cannot be committed, the runtime automatically restores the
frontier and replays the accepted tokens through one-token decode.

The retained gfx1151 implementation adds:

- lazy prompt-to-support KV seeding with contiguous cache-coverage tracking;
- verifier-prefix snapshots for accepted lengths one through four;
- grouped tile-4 execution for the six selected IQ2 gate/up experts;
- compact exact Q2 down-pair accumulation and narrow exact Q8 shapes for 3, 5,
  and 6 rows;
- a support-only 16384-to-24 FP16 kernel;
- managed support-weight residency;
- an acceptance scheduler that rejects clearly weak text after four probes,
  evaluates marginal text after eight, and backs off for 64 tokens below the
  measured 48% break-even point.

All production choices are enabled by default once
`--speculative dspark --dspark-model` is selected. There are no user-facing
policy knobs to tune.

The implementation follows the upstream DSpark quality contract: every
committed token is target-verified, but retaining batched verifier state is not
byte-identical to sequential decode. Sequential replay remains an internal
safety fallback and self-test, not a separate user policy.

### Quality and throughput by task type

Greedy generation, 128 tokens per prompt, chat-v2 framing, using the shared
ten-category corpus:

| Category | Exact vs AR | AR tok/s | DSpark tok/s | Speedup | Support accept | Attempts/skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| expository | no | 16.50 | 16.27 | 0.99x | 43.8% | 16/77 |
| code | no | 16.63 | 17.68 | 1.06x | 53.1% | 35/0 |
| reasoning | yes | 16.27 | 23.60 | 1.45x | 78.5% | 26/0 |
| summarization | no | 15.67 | 16.01 | 1.02x | 47.5% | 8/15 |
| Italian | no | 16.43 | 16.05 | 0.98x | 40.0% | 9/101 |
| Chinese | no | 16.42 | 15.57 | 0.95x | 23.3% | 6/115 |
| structured | yes | 15.95 | 21.30 | 1.33x | 69.0% | 29/0 |
| creative | no | 16.32 | 15.73 | 0.96x | 20.0% | 5/118 |
| repetitive | yes | 16.26 | **27.56** | **1.69x** | 94.8% | 23/0 |
| instruction | no | 16.44 | 15.65 | 0.95x | 23.3% | 6/115 |

Aggregate: AR 16.32 tok/s, DSpark 18.00 tok/s, 1.10x mean and 1.00x
median speedup. The scheduler attempted 163 blocks and skipped 541. Its observed
60.7% acceptance is selection-biased because it stops sampling weak requests.

A pre-retention characterization with backoff suppressed attempted 379 blocks
and measured 43.4% true support-token acceptance, 60.9% independent positional
agreement, and 21.4% full blocks. The earlier 39.9% report was not comparable:
it used raw prompts, included the target-known anchor in acceptance, and sampled
only a handful of blocks. The corresponding anchor-free number was 27.9%.

The raw repetitive corpus case is the stable throughput target:

| Workload | Exact vs AR | AR tok/s | DSpark tok/s | Speedup | Support accept |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `red, blue, blue` sequence | yes | 15.66 | **29.05** | **1.85x** | 100.0% |

This exceeds the requested 24--25 tok/s regime and is over 3x the original
8.78 tok/s DSpark route.

The internal sequential-replay check is byte-identical on all ten categories at
64 generated tokens. It is retained as a correctness test, not exposed as a
production policy.

### Prompt processing and verifier checks

Three interleaved 252-token prompt runs measured median prefill of 5,358.8 ms
autoregressive and 4,967.6 ms with DSpark attached, a 7.3% improvement within
run-to-run variance. Prompt processing does not regress.

The exact verifier and rollback checks passed at every production width:

| Rows | Exact | AR replay | Verify best |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 | 2/2 | 119.19 ms | 96.71 ms |
| 5 | 5/5 | 296.59 ms | 159.74 ms |
| 6 | 6/6 | 358.04 ms | 173.44 ms |

Issue #222's 75 ms verifier target is not met. The six-row route is retained
because seed-plus-five changes the amount of target work avoided, not because
the verifier itself reached that issue's projection target.

### Profile and retained/rejected decisions

Matched 64-token `rocprofv3` runs show total GPU kernel time falling from
7,471.87 ms autoregressive to 5,478.87 ms with DSpark, a 26.7% reduction. One
malformed ROCm dispatch with `end < start` was ignored; `tools/prof/prof.py`
now validates this and reports the count.

The one-time target Q8 transpose accounts for 2,454.51 ms and is not a
steady-state DSpark bottleneck. The principal repeated DSpark kernels were:

| Kernel family | Aggregate GPU time |
| --- | ---: |
| selected-expert IQ2 gate/up, tile 4 | 493.67 ms |
| compact Q2 down-pair accumulation | 381.71 ms |
| six-row prequantized Q8 projections | 375.18 ms |
| grouped verifier activation projection | 254.86 ms |

Routed MoE remains the repeated verifier bottleneck for #222. Prefix snapshots
were retained because they remove partial-accept replay and raise the production
corpus from 15.37 to 18.00 tok/s once paired with acceptance scheduling.

## Historical DSpark baseline (superseded)

Status: in progress under #156. The path is opt-in and is not wired into
generation, so nothing here affects the numbers above. DSpark is DeepSeek's own
drafter; it is unrelated to the Qwen DFlash and DFlash-2 paths.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Support artifact | `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf` (5.58 GiB resident) |
| Repository | `antirez/deepseek-v4-gguf` |
| Architecture | `deepseek4-dspark`, 3 stages, `block_size` 5, `markov_rank` 256 |
| Target features | layers 40, 41, 42, fused by `main_proj` (12288 -> 4096) |

### Measured

Greedy, 4K context, `--speculative dspark --dspark-model`.

| Stage | Cost |
| --- | ---: |
| Draft block (3 stages, 5 + 1 encoder rows) | 21 ms |
| Verification block, 5 rows | 152 ms |
| Autoregressive token | 60-65 ms |

Verification costs `59 ms + 18 ms/row` and is exact against autoregressive decode
at 2, 5, and 6 rows. Rollback restores the compressor frontier and reproduces the
pre-block continuation.

### Per task type

Ten prompts from the shared speculative corpus
(`benchmarks/qwen3.8-27b/speculative-corpus.json`), greedy, 32 tokens each,
through `tools/quant/speculative-corpus.py --backend dspark`:

| Prompt | Category | Exact | AR tok/s | DSpark tok/s | Speedup | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| expository_pangram | expository | yes | 13.42 | 11.30 | 0.84x | 24.0% |
| cpp_ring_buffer | code | yes | 15.45 | 11.31 | 0.73x | 24.0% |
| reasoning_train | reasoning | yes | 16.10 | 11.42 | 0.71x | 32.0% |
| summary_gpu | summarization | yes | 14.51 | 11.46 | 0.79x | 24.0% |
| italian_explanation | multilingual | yes | 15.55 | 11.55 | 0.74x | 20.0% |
| chinese_explanation | multilingual | yes | 16.71 | 11.31 | 0.68x | 28.0% |
| json_schedule | structured | yes | 16.71 | 11.32 | 0.68x | 24.0% |
| creative_station | creative | yes | 14.68 | 11.43 | 0.78x | 28.0% |
| repetition_sequence | repetitive | yes | 16.14 | 8.82 | 0.55x | 46.0% |
| instruction_debug | instruction | yes | 16.28 | 11.35 | 0.70x | 20.0% |

Aggregate: exact 10/10, AR 15.49 tok/s, DSpark 11.06 tok/s, speedup 0.71x,
median 0.72x, acceptance 28.7%.

**Quality is preserved exactly**: every category reproduces autoregressive
decode's completion byte for byte. **Throughput is not.** The path is opt-in
behind `--speculative dspark`, off by default, and on this hardware with this
drafter it should stay off.

### Why: exactness and speed are mutually exclusive here

The only saving speculative decoding can offer is *not running* a decode step for
an accepted token. Taking that saving means keeping the key/value rows the batched
verification pass wrote. Those rows are not the bytes one-token decode would have
written, and the difference compounds: a 48-token generation with fully accepted
blocks diverged from autoregressive decode at the tail even though every accepted
token was individually correct.

So there are two regimes, both measured:

| Commit policy | Byte-exact vs decode | Aggregate |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Replay accepted prefix through decode (historical default) | yes | 0.71x |
| Keep verifier cache state | no | 0.54x |

Direct commit does not currently help because it only applies when *every* drafted
row is accepted, and at a mean accepted length of 1.35 out of 5 that is rare. The
replay path therefore dominates either way, at one full decode step per accepted
token.

**In the exact regime the theoretical maximum is 1.0x**, reached by never drafting:
every emitted token still costs a decode step, plus the draft and verification on
top. The break-even controller exists to approach that bound rather than to win;
the residual 0.71x is the cost of its periodic probes on short requests.

### What would actually make this faster

A cycle costs `21 ms draft + 152 ms verify`. Measured per-position draft accuracy
is 0.62, so prefix matching yields a mean accepted length of `sum p^k` = 1.47 over
five positions, against a break-even of about 1.9 accepted.

| Change | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Per-row prefix snapshots (`DS4_SPEC_PREFIX_SLOTS` upstream) so partial accepts restore rather than replay | ~1.3x, and only in the non-byte-exact regime |
| Narrower verification cost (#222) | another 20-30 ms per block |
| Tree or multi-candidate verification | the only route to ~2x |

Lengthening the block does not help: at `p = 0.62`, five positions give 1.47 and
eight give 1.56. The binding constraint is the prefix-matching topology combined
with this checkpoint's per-position accuracy, not kernel cost or dispatch.

### The bound, as an inequality

For a block of `r` verified rows with mean accepted length `a`:

```
speedup <= decode_ms * (1 + a) / (draft_ms + fixed_ms + marginal_ms * r)
```

Floors for the cost terms on this checkpoint, from weight traffic at the 242 GB/s
DRAM ceiling rather than from the current kernels:

Routed-expert traffic is the term that decides this, and it depends on how much
the rows of a block share experts. Measured with
`GUFO_DEEPSEEK_ROCM_MOE_EXPERT_SPREAD=1` over 45 five-row blocks: a block issues
30 `(row, expert)` pairs but touches a **median of 19 distinct experts** (mean
17.7, range 14-26). About 40% of expert traffic is therefore the same weights
reloaded for a different row, and the small-batch route currently pays all of it
because it is indexed per `(row, expert)` pair.

| Term | Floor | Why |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `fixed_ms` | ~33 ms | 6 GiB dense Q8 weights plus the first row's 6 experts, once per block |
| `marginal_ms` | ~6 ms | about 3 newly touched experts per additional row, plus its LM head row |
| `draft_ms` | ~20 ms | measured; the three DSpark stages are small |
| `decode_ms` | ~65 ms | measured autoregressive step |

At `r = 5` and the measured `a = 1.44` that gives
`65 * 2.44 / (20 + 33 + 30) = 1.91x` as the ceiling **with perfect kernels and
expert deduplication**. So "almost 2x" is reachable with this drafter; the gap is
kernel efficiency, not drafter accuracy.

An earlier revision of this section put the ceiling at 1.67x by charging every
`(row, expert)` pair a full expert load. That was wrong: it ignored the overlap
measured above.

### The ladder to get there

Each step is measured or derived from the terms above; verification is 152 ms today
against a 63 ms floor.

| Step | Verify | Aggregate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Today, replaying accepted prefixes through decode | 152 ms | 0.71x |
| Per-row prefix snapshots, so no accept ever replays | 152 ms | ~0.92x |
| Expert deduplication for narrow batches | ~132 ms | ~1.03x |
| Dense projections at the bandwidth floor (#222) | ~90 ms | ~1.4x |
| All terms at their floors | ~63 ms | ~1.9x |

Two constraints on that ladder. First, every step past the first requires the
non-byte-exact commit regime, because the saving *is* not re-running decode for an
accepted token. Second, prefix snapshots are the prerequisite: without them a
partial accept replays about 86 ms per cycle, which is more than the entire
verification budget at the floor.

### Ablations

Conventions a support checkpoint does not record, each settled by measured
acceptance rather than assumption (12 cycles, first prompt above):

| Variant | First-token hits | Acceptance |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Block at L, Markov on, forward slots, non-causal, direct KV** | **5/12** | **11.7%** |
| Hyper-connection-form KV injection | 4/12 | 10.0% |
| Causal block attention | 5/12 | 8.3% |
| Markov off (per-position argmax) | 3/12 | 5.0% |
| Reversed slot order | 3/12 | 5.0% |
| Block at L-1 | 2/12 | 5.0% |

Every structural choice in the retained configuration wins its comparison, which
is why the remaining gap is being treated as numerical. The losing A/B paths
were removed rather than exposed as user configuration.

Acceptance is one scalar at the end of a ten-stage chain and cannot localize the
fault; the next step is a numerical oracle that compares the fused feature, each
stage's hidden state, and the base logits against the upstream DSpark path for a
fixed input.
