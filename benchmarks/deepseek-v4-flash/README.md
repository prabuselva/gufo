# DeepSeek V4 Flash on Strix Halo

Linux x86-64, AMD Strix Halo `gfx1151`, 128 GB unified memory. All model timings
use Nix release binaries. `C` is simultaneous requests. Prefill payloads are shown in each table; generation uses **128 tokens** at each
listed context depth.

Results are means of two repetitions. The C1 autoregressive table uses the
[latest bulk-kernel sweep](bulk-kernels.md); DSpark and
multiple-user tables retain the earlier [full matrix](speed-matrix.json).
Both reports retain deviations, token hashes and binary/model identities.
C1 has the highest per-user generation rate at every depth.

## Single user, autoregressive

| Context depth | pp4096 tok/s | tg128 tok/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 490.03 | 17.73 |
| 4,096 | 482.87 | 15.90 |
| 8,192 | 471.78 | 15.75 |
| 12,288 | 465.62 | 15.57 |
| 16,384 | 457.08 | 15.44 |

The matched 4K control confirms about **0.6% faster prefill** from mixed MoE
row tiles. Generation has no qualified gain from this round. See the
[comparison and limits](bulk-kernels.md); the earlier projection/selection
change delivered the larger [5.4–6.2% generation gain](selection-projection.md).

## Single user, DSpark

| Context depth | pp2048 tok/s | tg128 tok/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 452.23 | 16.50 |
| 4,096 | 440.47 | 39.53 |
| 8,192 | 432.81 | 38.50 |
| 12,288 | 427.24 | 37.74 |
| 16,384 | 420.87 | 36.03 |

Warm C1 prefill reaches **468.5 / 464.8 tok/s at pp2048** and
**492.9 / 487.7 tok/s at pp4096** (AR / DSpark; four warm repetitions).
The first C1/depth-zero prefill row above includes first-use work, which lowers
its mean and increases its deviation. The full report retains both measurements.

## Multiple users, DSpark

Cells are **aggregate pp2048 / per-user tg128**, in tok/s.

| Context depth | C2 | C4 | C6 | C8 |

In the earlier matched matrix, DSpark speeds up generation at 4K–16K by **2.48–2.62× at C1,
1.77–1.82× at C2, 1.34–1.35× at C4, and 1.10–1.13× at C6**.
C8 is about 2% slower at 4K/8K and 3–4% faster at 12K/16K.
Depth-zero generation is 0.8–6.4% slower with DSpark on this workload.

DSpark chooses draft lengths from [measured cycle costs](cost-calibration.json)
and backs off when acceptance is too low. It skips cycles whose verification
cost cannot be repaid even at full acceptance. Decisions use token history and
offline calibration; wall-clock timing never changes token decisions. Sampled requests
draft in the same cohort as greedy peers: each verified row is drawn with the
request sampler and accepted while the draw reproduces the draft, so a seeded
request emits the tokens autoregressive decoding would; acceptance is the
target probability of the draft and falls with temperature. Changes
in concurrency reset the decision history. Complete support state and controller
state survive snapshots; a new request reusing a prefix starts fresh statistics.

## Sampled requests, `temperature 0.6`

Cells are **per-user tg128 AR / DSpark**, in tok/s, with the DSpark support
acceptance; `--seed 7`, pp2048, two repetitions, from the
[sampled matrix](sampled-speed-matrix.json). Every request's DSpark output
hash equals its autoregressive hash.

| Context depth | C1 | C2 | C4 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 17.27 / 15.69 (0.13) | 16.25 / 24.88 (0.87) | 13.63 / 14.12 (0.91) |
| 4,096 | 15.46 / 39.15 (1.00) | 13.66 / 24.17 (1.00) | 10.51 / 13.64 (1.00) |
| 8,192 | 15.31 / 38.34 (1.00) | 13.43 / 22.37 (1.00) | 10.29 / 13.29 (1.00) |
| 12,288 | 15.15 / 37.56 (1.00) | 13.14 / 21.81 (1.00) | 9.94 / 12.93 (1.00) |
| 16,384 | 15.03 / 35.93 (0.98) | 12.97 / 21.24 (1.00) | 9.77 / 12.58 (1.00) |

The fixed repeating benchmark sequence leaves the target distribution nearly a
spike at 4K–16K, so sampled acceptance equals greedy acceptance there and the
speedups (**2.39–2.53× at C1, 1.64–1.77× at C2, 1.29–1.30× at C4**) match the
greedy tables; the sampled cycle adds no measurable cost. The depth-zero seed
is the only point where draws reject drafts (C1 backs off after 5 cycles).

Natural text is where temperature matters. The serving harness on the shared
speculative corpus (`--corpus-layout distinct`, 128-token budget, one warmup
and two rounds, release servers with eight sessions, 8K context) reports
aggregate output tok/s **AR / DSpark** with the DSpark support acceptance:

| Temperature | C1 | C2 | C4 | C8 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 16.2 / 20.5 (0.66) | 25.8 / 26.0 (0.71) | 39.2 / 35.7 (0.75) | 49.3 / 45.8 (skipped) |
| 0.6 | 16.3 / 22.0 (0.63) | 25.6 / 25.6 (0.66) | 38.3 / 33.6 (0.64) | 46.5 / 45.1 (0.60) |
| 1.0 | 16.3 / 19.1 (0.56) | 25.5 / 25.4 (0.63) | 38.6 / 33.0 (0.66) | 44.4 / 44.2 (0.62) |

Sampled acceptance stays 0.56–0.66 through `temperature 1.0`, above the 0.48
break-even, so the sampled cycle behaves like the greedy one at every width:
C1 gains 17–35%, C2 is even, and C4/C8 on these short prompts lose 3–14% in
both modes, the known depth-zero cost of the concurrent policy rather than a
sampling effect. Reports: `serving-{ar,dspark}-t{0,0.6,1.0}.json`.

## C1 memory with a 262,144-token capacity

The 80.76 GiB target weights are only part of the footprint: DSpark adds
5.58 GiB of support weights, and inference also needs projection caches,
KV state, and work buffers. The runtime reuses scratch across consecutive
attention and FFN stages, omits the dense attention mask, and grows compressed
KV storage and indexer score scratch with actual context use. Cache precision
is unchanged; prefill reserves 128 tokens of decode headroom.

| C1 DSpark workload | Previous GPU allocation (GiB) | Current (GiB) | Saved (GiB) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| pp2048/4096 + tg128 | 98.79 | 90.74 | 8.06 |
| 16K prefix, pp4096 + tg128 | 98.79 | 91.46 | 7.33 |

These are driver GTT measurements, not whole-system RAM usage. The
[memory report](memory-c1-262k.json) retains matched release runs, exact output
hashes and draft counts, timings, and memory observations. Scratch reuse and
growing KV save another **6.07 GiB** at pp2048/4096 beyond the earlier indexer
scratch reduction. The controls found no material speed regression; a separate
256-token continuation checks growth during generation. Only up to 20,608
tokens are used; capacity does not imply filling the window. KV storage grows
with longer inputs.

```

Prefill and generation are separate measurements. The prefix uses a fixed
repeating token sequence, identical across concurrent requests; generation
follows the model’s greedy choices. Depth-zero generation uses a 16-token seed. Context preparation and
snapshot restoration occur outside timing. Prefill runs each request in
sequence and reports aggregate prompt throughput; decode reports 128 divided
by the whole batch's elapsed seconds.
Stop-token IDs count toward the fixed workload. Verbose output records generated
token hashes and draft counters for every request and repetition. Natural
prompts can have different acceptance and speed. Run model jobs and builds
sequentially, including correctness runs; the 128 GB memory is shared by CPU
and GPU. Keep other CPU/GPU work out of timed runs. HTTP scheduling measurements
use the shared `tools/serving/gufo-serving-bench.py` with matched prompts, caching,
output budgets, concurrency, and repetitions.

## Quality contract

**Qualification:** the [prior complete run](quality-qualification.json) passes
all nine checks, including 736 exact DSpark scalar replay choices through C8/16K.
The [projection/selection changes](selection-projection.md) retain the pinned target
trajectory and all 1,280 paired token positions in the repeated C1 speed sweep.
Their projection, attention, target and full DSpark checks pass, including all
736 scalar replay choices and exact frontier logits through C8/16K.
The [bulk-kernel follow-up](bulk-kernels.md) also passes projection/attention,
target and full DSpark checks, including the same 736 exact replay choices.
Its C1 pp4096/tg128 sweep and reversed control retain all 1,792 paired token
positions; the DSpark check retained at least 15.37 GiB available.
The repeated speed matrix passes exact output/hash and draft-counter checks:
53,760 generated tokens across both modes and repetitions. Its DSpark run kept
at least 13.89 GiB available under a 12 GiB memory guard.
Full capability qualification remains pending.
Antirez comparisons flag four post-prefill differences; they do not establish
which implementation is more accurate.
See the [scores and limits](eval/README.md).

DS4 checks live in [one directory](../../tests/models/deepseek_v4_flash/CMakeLists.txt).
Shared sampler, scheduler, and HTTP tests remain with their shared components.
The [tools index](../../tools/ds4/README.md) lists the maintained entry points.

The pinned target trajectory requires at least 116/128 top-1 choices, rank sum
at most 142, and worst rank at most 3. State comparisons require finite logits,
RMSE ≤1.12, cosine ≥0.979, and max error ≤5. DSpark scalar replay requires exact greedy tokens (including tie-breaking)
and frontier logits. The eight-scenario C1/C2/C4/C6/C8 replay through 16K
covers **736 token choices** across four diverse continuations. Never weaken these bounds to accept a faster implementation.
The replay records speculative frontiers, frees those sessions, then checks
one scalar session at a time, keeping at most C model sessions resident.

Repeatability means identical inputs, seeds, and execution schedule, including
prefill boundaries and batch membership. AR/DSpark output equality passes this
speed workload; general text equality and batch-composition invariance are not
established. Check repeated output hashes and draft decisions alongside
speed; throughput alone cannot qualify a change. Retain an optimization only
after the relevant numerical oracle, model checks, and repeated release A/B
measurements pass. During iteration, run the affected fast/kernel checks; run
the complete model/serving suite for retained changes. Extend coverage for newly affected shapes and shared runners.
AR qualification also requires the external 100-case continuation comparison:
agreement between DSpark and AR cannot detect a bug shared by both paths.
The scorer records every reference token; compare likelihood and greedy
agreement against a matched independent upstream control. The same command
compares full logits before and after 128 forced tokens at all five depths,
using matched 2K and 4K prefill calls. It checks exact repeated Gufo output,
identical input token IDs, and actual prefill capacities.
It retains the full-logit bounds above and rejects a detectable 100-case NLL
increase using a paired case bootstrap 95% interval (seed 731).
Antirez is an independent implementation, not ground truth. Cross-engine logit
differences require investigation against the official computation and task
scores; do not add approximations solely to match another implementation.
Separate GGUF quantization error from additional kernel approximations. The HC
oracle uses GGUF weight precision with the official FP32 activation formula.
Repeated-word prompts probe numerical behavior, not long-context task accuracy.
Capability subset results: TODO. Full capability scores remain TODO; see the
[retained AR evaluation](eval/README.md) for earlier regression samples.

## Experiments

- Retained: simpler IQ2 signs and mixed MoE down row tiles; **about 0.6% faster pp4096** in the matched 4K control, no qualified generation gain. Q8 load variants and global MMQ row-tile changes did not justify new routes. [Results](bulk-kernels.md).
- Retained: vector C1 projections, cached RMS and exact partial top-k; **5.4–6.2% faster C1 tg128** across 0–16K with identical tokens. Full norm/projection fusion was slower and removed. [Results and profile](selection-projection.md).
- Retained: indexer head accumulation removes 31 block barriers per score; C1 tg128 at 16K improves **0.8–1.0%** in repeated release A/B, with identical tokens. [Official-kernel review and next opportunities](official-kernel-review.md).
- Retained: scalar-equivalent verifier projections and attention; exact 736-token replay across the maintained concurrency/depth matrix.
- Retained: attention ring indexing; removes integer division without changing arithmetic.
- Retained: reusable request scratch and complete DSpark snapshots; exact continuation across changing batch membership and session capacities.
- Retained: exact-size weight allocations remove 6.74 GiB of arena padding; the complete guarded DSpark suite kept at least 13.84 GiB available.
- Retained: official DSpark feature injection and 128-row attention window, checked independently across ring boundaries.
- Retained: direct IQ2 activation reads; C8 verifier gate/up GPU time 140.94→62.29 ms, total verifier 531.08→452.74 ms, exact scalar outputs.
- Rejected: F16 rounding inside fused HC; closer to Antirez's logits, but adds an approximation absent from the official formula.
- Retained: concurrent cost policy calibrated at 0/4K/16K; the repeated full sweep passes output equality and reports the gains and losses above.
- Rejected: speculative MMQ (numerical mismatch), confidence trimming and alternate grouped gate variants (no qualified speed win).
- Rejected: two prefill Q2 column fragments; exact logits, pp2048 fell 502.09→490.74 tok/s.
- Current profiles: Q8 projections remain about 51% of generation GPU time; quantized matrix multiplication takes about 36% of pp4096 GPU time. [Profile and rejected experiments](bulk-kernels.md).
