# DeepSeek V4 Flash Q2-imatrix on Strix Halo

Status: 2026-08-21. This page is the current functional and performance
snapshot, not an optimization history.

## Model

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `antirez/deepseek-v4-gguf` |
| Snapshot | `1cd7b564460821938add0475a60b942c409295e0` |
| Artifact | `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf` |
| Size | 80.76 GiB |
| Engine source | `antirez/ds4` at `84cc882352757baf628a1776badf7cc54d584e28` |
| Backend | Model-private ROCm/HIP implementation for `gfx1151` |

The DeepSeek graph, quantized layouts, session state, dispatch, and numerical
kernels live under `src/models/deepseek_v4_flash`. They do not call Qwen
kernels or share mutable Qwen state.

## Run

Build through the repository flake and define the artifact path:

```sh
git add .
nix build

MODEL=/path/to/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf
```

Run a terminal prompt:

```sh
./result/bin/strix-server prompt \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --raw-prompt \
  --prompt 'The capital of France is' \
  --max-tokens 16 \
  --temperature 0
```

Run the sparse long-context benchmark. Each prompt row adds a 2K suffix to the
prepared depth, and each generation row produces 128 autoregressive tokens.
Frontiers are extended incrementally and restored from in-memory snapshots.

```sh
./result/bin/strix-server bench \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --n-prompt 2048 \
  --n-gen 128 \
  --n-depth 2048,8192,16384,32768,65536 \
  --repetitions 1 \
  --verbose
```

The same artifact can be served through the existing OpenAI-compatible
completion and chat endpoints:

```sh
./result/bin/strix-server serve \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080
```

## Current Results

The Strix rows use the release package, one repetition, a 2K prompt suffix, and
128 generated tokens. The DS4 reference is the supplied same-machine result
for the same artifact. Prompt rows compare the final context after adding the
2K suffix; generation rows compare the prepared depth.

| Prepared depth | Strix `pp2048` | DS4 `pp2048` | Delta | Strix `tg128` | DS4 `tg128` | Delta | Snapshot bytes |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2K | 206.33 | 205.49 | +0.4% | 15.63 | 14.76 | +5.9% | 52,184,460 |
| 8K | 204.22 | 197.13 | +3.6% | 14.65 | 13.87 | +5.6% | 136,750,476 |
| 16K | 197.79 | 190.09 | +4.1% | 14.39 | 13.63 | +5.6% | 249,505,164 |
| 32K | 179.18 | 171.83 | +4.3% | 13.66 | 12.93 | +5.6% | 475,014,540 |
| 64K | not remeasured | not supplied | - | 12.42 | 11.91 | +4.3% | 926,033,292 |

The model loads 80.76 GiB of tensor spans in about 21 seconds. The 64K run
plans 82.07 GiB total, including model, KV state, and working buffers.
The 2K decode value was confirmed by two paired candidate samples; the 8K-32K
rows come from one sparse-depth sweep. The 64K
prompt row was not rerun because the retained prompt-kernel gain was already
stable through 32K.

A separate full-prompt comparison isolates the retained prompt kernels:

| Prompt | Baseline | Current | Delta |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4K | 194.31 | 202.15 | +4.0% |
| 8K | 203.54 | 209.01 | +2.7% |
| 16K | 203.75 | 210.02 | +3.1% |

The 4K values are means from an interleaved baseline/candidate replay. The 8K
and 16K values are matched release-package runs. The current paired attention
route keeps FP32 compressed KV authoritative and maintains a derived FP16 mirror
for ratio-4 attention layers. Indexed-attention time falls from 82.07 ms to
55.72 ms per layer (-32.1%); fused mirror production adds 0.22 ms total. The
wave32 kernel uses 80 VGPRs, 57,992 bytes LDS, zero scratch, and 32 waves per
workgroup. The mirror adds about 21, 42, 84, 168, and 336 MiB at 4K, 8K, 16K,
32K, and 64K respectively, while snapshot payloads remain unchanged.

## Quality and Integration

- The pinned upstream DS4 CLI and packaged Strix CLI produce the exact same
  four-token greedy continuation, ` Paris. It is`, for the same raw prompt and
  artifact.
- A pinned 128-token teacher-forced trajectory keeps at least 116/128 reference
  tokens at top-1, every reference token within top-3, and aggregate rank at
  most 142. This catches sustained numerical drift without treating
  free-running near-tie flips as state corruption.
- A 273-token batched-prefill versus sequential-state comparison matches the
  immutable pre-optimization envelope: RMSE at most 1.12, cosine at least
  0.979, maximum logit error at most 5.0, and the sequential winner remains
  within the batched top-3.
- Full logits are finite after real GGUF prefill.
- Snapshot restore reproduces the exact position, greedy token, and logit
  vector.
- Direct model sessions and the HTTP backend produce identical raw and chat
  token sequences.
- Cancellation returns the request session cleanly for exact subsequent reuse.
- Terminal prompt, benchmark, raw completion, and chat completion use the same
  model-owned engine and tokenizer.

## Successful

- Adapted the required DS4 graph and ROCm kernels into repository-owned C++20
  `runtime` and `kernels/rocm` packages.
- Removed standalone distributed, tensor-parallel, SSD weight streaming,
  multi-GPU placement, CPU reference, MTP, steering, and embedded hotlist
  implementations from the production closure.
- Converted the private fork to native ROCm/HIP naming and APIs.
- Kept DeepSeek code, kernels, state, and dispatch isolated from Qwen.
- Reused the existing Strix CLI, benchmark, and OpenAI-compatible server.
- Matched the DS4 state payload sizes and stayed close to or ahead of the
  supplied throughput curve through 64K.
- Reduced the six-expert Q2-down kernel by 7.8% with a two-way compiler unroll;
  `tg128` improved 1.2% at 2K and 0.6-0.7% at 8K-32K without changing VGPR,
  LDS, or scratch allocation.
- Reused each routed-MoE activation tile across four Q2-down output fragments
  and aliased the epilogue over dead staging LDS. Full-prompt throughput improves
  1.1-2.7%, while the canonical 2K-suffix prompt rows improve about 4-5%
  through 32K.
- Added a derived FP16 compressed-KV mirror and 32-head wave32 indexed-attention
  route for large prompt batches. Full-prompt throughput improves 2.7-4.0% and
  canonical 2K-suffix prompt rows improve 2.4-3.3% through 32K, with neutral
  autoregressive throughput and unchanged serialized state.

## Failed

- Automatic CMake discovery was not reliable for the header-only ROCm
  dependencies in a clean Nix sandbox. Explicit flake-provided include roots
  are retained.
- The upstream DS4 frontend build is not imported. Strix owns CLI, HTTP,
  benchmarking, cancellation, and session pooling.
- Q8 projection row grouping (`1/2/4/8`) and high-compression row grouping
  (`8/16/32`) produced no repeatable end-to-end improvement.
- Q2-down LDS aliasing alone was noise (`192.01` versus `192.13 tok/s` at
  4K); it is retained only because it enables the faster four-fragment kernel.
- An 8K prefill capacity regressed the 8K prompt (`201.80` versus `210.21
  tok/s`) and was noise in a 16K replay (`204.14` versus `203.62 tok/s`), so
  the existing 4K chunk policy remains.
- Wave32 indexed attention against the FP32 compressed cache was slower on its
  own (`193.49` versus `195.73 tok/s` at 4K); the route is retained only with
  fused production of the derived FP16 mirror.
- Native MMQ, device expert queues, cached hipBLASLt projection routing, and
  dense-Q8 32/128-token tile variants either failed the quality envelope or
  regressed the 4K prompt and were removed.

## To Do

- Add model-owned thinking/reasoning mode and effort controls; the current chat
  template intentionally uses the no-thinking path.
- Run the compact `strix-eval` qualification suite when #153 is implemented.
- Profile and optimize the model-owned gfx1151 kernels under #155.
- Add DSpark speculative decoding under #156.
- Add model-owned offline calibration/imatrix tooling only when a new
  quantization recipe requires it.
- Add multi-session scheduling and restart-safe SSD state reuse through the
  serving milestones.
